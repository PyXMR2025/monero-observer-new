17:01:11 <Rucknium[m]> Meeting time: https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/728
17:01:16 <Rucknium[m]> 1. Greetings
17:01:21 <Rucknium[m]> Hi
17:01:25 <one-horse-wagon[> Hello
17:01:28 <xmrack[m]> Hi
17:01:31 <rbrunner> Hello
17:01:48 <jberman[m]> hello
17:03:04 <Rucknium[m]> 2. Updates, what's everyone working on?
17:04:10 <Rucknium[m]> Me: OSPEAD work. Reviewing xmrack 's work. Also, took an inventory of which multicoin wallets survived the hard fork. It's been a bit of a bloodbath.
17:04:33 <xmrack[m]> I’m doing last minute editing on my final report for the MAGIC grant. It should be released later in a post to reddit and matrix
17:05:14 <Rucknium[m]> xmrack: Do you want to discuss the results during this meeting, or wait until next one?
17:05:56 <xmrack[m]> I think we can do that next week once everyone has given the report at least a skim
17:06:00 <rbrunner> I think most, if not all, multicoin wallets depend either directly on MyMonero, or copy technology from there, and if MyMonero is late, a bloodbath results ...
17:07:23 <Rucknium[m]> I don't think all of them rely on MyMonero. Here's my list, with date of fix:
17:07:52 <one-horse-wagon[> rbrunner: Why would a wallet like MyMonero be so late with an update when they hold themselves out as mainly being a Monero wallet?  Doesn't make sense.
17:07:52 <jberman[m]> me: submitted wallet<>daemon hard fork compatibility PR (8544) and started looking into the borked multisig seed recovery: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/8537
17:08:10 <Rucknium[m]> Wookey (Aug 19), Exodus (Aug 25), Edge (Aug 27), MyMonero (Aug 29), Not yet fixed: Atomic, Coinomi, Guarda, Zelcore.
17:08:13 <jberman[m]> no tangible updates on my end from last week on getting multisig security proofs done, but figure it's worth sharing I'm also considering approaching Cypher Stack/Sarang to discuss working with them as well
17:08:35 <Rucknium[m]> If anyone has different info, let me know. I have gathered info from Twitter and Reddit.
17:09:31 <rbrunner> one-horse-wagon: complicated story, they detailed their woes and their bad luck on Reddit.
17:12:34 <Rucknium[m]> In a few months I may submit another CCS to (1) Evaluate safety of altering the wallet2 decoy selection algorithm when not at a hard fork; (2) Prepared an OSPEAD manuscript for submission to an academic journal; (3) Evaluate different methods for transitioning decoy selection for Seraphis transactions. 
17:13:20 <rbrunner> https://www.reddit.com/r/MyMonero/comments/wxbdb9/mymonero_important_announcement/
17:13:53 <Rucknium[m]> rbrunner's "no wallet left behind" for Seraphis seems to be particularly important given the recent hard fork wallet bloodbath
17:14:55 <rbrunner> Yes, that hardfork will be several orders of magnitude bigger than this comparatively small update
17:15:14 <rbrunner> And if you don't prepare you will miss for more than a few days :)
17:15:44 <kayabaNerve> Even nowadays we can discuss wallet upgrades being annoying thanks to items such as Polyseed :/
17:16:02 <xmrack[m]> I havent been around for many hardforks. Was what we saw with v15 normal? Should we consider giving more time for subsequent forks?
17:16:08 <kayabaNerve> *just in how it's a different seed format. I personally greatly appreciate it and believe it should be used.
17:16:56 <rbrunner> Rucknium: Where would you place OSPEAD public disclosure in this timeline?
17:17:01 <hyc> I don't think the MyMonero fumble this time around was a normal occurrence
17:17:02 <Rucknium[m]> How many other coins have hard forks where old tx formats are not compatible? I wonder if some of the wallets didn't understand that they had to take action with the hard fork.
17:17:04 <sech1> xmrack[m] v15 was more hectic than usual
17:17:09 <sech1> in terms of wallet support
17:17:20 <rbrunner> Or better, disclosure of the underlying problems
17:18:00 <hyc> and anyone who used wallet2 would have been able to integrate the new library well in advance
17:18:08 <jberman[m]> MyMonero offered me contracted work to prepare their libraries for the hard fork before the fork. I decided I wouldn't want to work on moving forward a centralized wallet scanning service that has access to view keys (unless the wallet makes it extremely clear what the tradeoff is and tucks the option deep into the config settings rather than defaults it). They were not interested in such a drastic change at this time
17:18:42 <rbrunner> Interesting background info
17:18:46 <sech1> maybe we need to think of a way to _force_ everyone to update _before_ the fork. Like mini-fork or something when new nodes refuse to serve RPC to old wallets
17:18:46 <Rucknium[m]> rbrunner: The decision is mostly up to the review panel. Hopefully they will be done reviewing by end of October. If disclosure is cleared, hopefully we can do it in November/December. If no disclosure, then no (2) in my list above.
17:19:16 <rbrunner> Alright, thanks. Looking forward to it, as a curious person
17:19:42 <hyc> ringCT hardfork went pretty smoothly. this is certainly not the first time we've migrated txn formats.
17:21:10 <kayabaNerve> sech1: Isn't that just the hard fork but without the benefits of it
17:21:36 <rbrunner> Yeah, and I guess users don't care why exactly their wallets don't work anymore, right?
17:21:47 <rbrunner> Mini-hardfork or not
17:22:32 <rbrunner> Maybe make the wallets 10 times slower ...
17:22:34 <sech1> I guess we can't solve 3rd-party developers' lazyness on protocol level :D
17:22:59 <rbrunner> Or calculate 10 times higher fees :)
17:23:37 <rbrunner> Something like ETH's difficulty bomb
17:24:15 <Rucknium[m]> It's unfortunate for users. On the other hand, I am not too sad about the death of wallets that have defects in transaction uniformity. 
17:24:15 <one-horse-wagon[> sech1: You really can't force people to upgrade because some people may go away from Monero for years.  As it is right now, they can upgrade their wallets and all is good to go.
17:24:45 <sech1> They'll just upgrade when they get back?
17:24:50 <sech1> I'm talking about wallet developers
17:25:45 <sech1> something like protocol-level warning before the hardfork, so you can still use the wallet but with some limitations
17:26:13 <hyc> sounds like a lot of effort for not much gain
17:26:27 <hyc> as it is, they will certainly have limitations once the hardfork occurs ..
17:26:56 <rbrunner> Call it natural selection for wallets. Adapt or die.
17:27:02 <jberman[m]> <sech1> "maybe we need to think of a..." <- I considered this for 8544; would have vastly simplified that PR to just break clients immediately and require they update once the fork code is ready to go. But I think the optimal UX is a smooth update transition where wallets give warnings ahead of time. Plenty of modern apps use an approach like this
17:27:29 <jberman[m]> As far as avoiding this fork's problems, as basically mentioned above MyMonero uses their own custom client<>lws<>daemon setup; I doubt their setup would be break-able pre-fork to avoid the issue
17:27:52 <sech1> yes, an RPC call that tells you "fork is coming" is already better than nothing
17:27:58 <sech1> good wallets will show warnings to users
17:28:30 <hyc> isn't fork info already available in monerod rpc?
17:29:37 <sech1> that rpc call is not about upcoming forks
17:29:47 <sech1> https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/8544 adds this data
17:30:18 <hyc> I also seem to recall that while we were still on regular 6 month upgrades, the daemon would have a timed announcement of "you should be looking for a software update" or somesuch
17:30:33 <sech1> it was a guesstimate
17:30:40 <sech1> daemon didn't know the actual fork height
17:30:47 <hyc> yes...
17:31:20 <rbrunner> and was wrong often enough at the end as to basically only annoy
17:31:26 <Rucknium[m]> Many of the wallets do not have a check next to their checklist here:
17:31:27 <Rucknium[m]> https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/690
17:31:35 <sech1> with 8544, if most nodes update well in advance, users will start getting proper warnings
17:31:40 <Rucknium[m]> It could be mostly a matter of better communication. Not sure.
17:31:45 <hyc> perhaps we can add a P2P
