10/29/2022, 6:01:26 PM - ajs_[m]: 1. Greetings
10/29/2022, 6:01:27 PM - msvb-web: Hello.
10/29/2022, 6:01:30 PM - ajs_[m]: hello
10/29/2022, 6:01:32 PM - monerobull[m]: Hi
10/29/2022, 6:01:34 PM - franciscom: Hello
10/29/2022, 6:03:08 PM - ajs_[m]: 2. venue status
10/29/2022, 6:04:38 PM - monerobull[m]: Well?
10/29/2022, 6:06:12 PM - ajs_[m]: we are still waiting on la fabrika to get back to us
10/29/2022, 6:06:25 PM - ajs_[m]: they have been slow with responses
10/29/2022, 6:06:57 PM - monerobull[m]: Hm
10/29/2022, 6:07:17 PM - ajs_[m]: i got more info for the Neuchâtel option
10/29/2022, 6:07:22 PM - ajs_[m]: https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/monerokon-neuchatel-9x2b?lang=en
10/29/2022, 6:08:08 PM - ajs_[m]: this place has been reserved for 30th June - 3rd July 2023 https://www.unine.ch/batiments/home/prestations/location-de-laula-des-jeunes-riv.html
10/29/2022, 6:08:50 PM - ajs_[m]: the cost for venue rental is around 4.5k eur for 3 days
10/29/2022, 6:09:37 PM - monerobull[m]: That's very reasonable 
10/29/2022, 6:09:37 PM - ajs_[m]: the hall is fully equipped 
10/29/2022, 6:10:00 PM - ajs_[m]: and we can plan the event around "swiss privacy week"
10/29/2022, 6:10:38 PM - monerobull[m]: I would prefer Prague but this looks like a very good alternative 
10/29/2022, 6:11:22 PM - ajs_[m]: there is a bitcoin event the same week, we could possibly collab with 
10/29/2022, 6:12:27 PM - monerobull[m]: Depends on how maxi they are 😅
10/29/2022, 6:13:46 PM - ajs_[m]: I like Prague too, because Parallel Polis is close to La Fabrika
10/29/2022, 6:14:34 PM - ajs_[m]: but they are slow in getting back to us
10/29/2022, 6:15:14 PM - monerobull[m]: So what's the plan, deadline for la Fabrika and then switch to Switzerland?
10/29/2022, 6:16:05 PM - ajs_[m]: i think we should set a deadline for a response
10/29/2022, 6:16:50 PM - ajs_[m]: if we get nothing, then we can consider the venue a no go and turn our focus back to Switzerland
10/29/2022, 6:16:56 PM - monerobull[m]: By next meeting or before? How urgent is it?
10/29/2022, 6:17:36 PM - ajs_[m]: depends on turn around time for merch orders
10/29/2022, 6:17:36 PM - ajs_[m]: thoughts msvb-web ?
10/29/2022, 6:17:50 PM - monerobull[m]: We have merch already set up?
10/29/2022, 6:18:01 PM - ajs_[m]: not yet
10/29/2022, 6:18:13 PM - msvb-web: Merchandise will be in development regardless of the venue, and the capacity doesn't change much our plan either.
10/29/2022, 6:18:19 PM - monerobull[m]: We could just do a generic design without mentioning location 😬
10/29/2022, 6:19:11 PM - msvb-web: Most of the merchandise items are not location dependent, probably this year's designs will mix the three brands Monero, Konferenco, and Monero Devices.
10/29/2022, 6:19:13 PM - ajs_[m]: we would need to find a warehouse that could receive and store shipments
10/29/2022, 6:19:21 PM - msvb-web: To really do a 100% Konferenco we need more months of lead time.
10/29/2022, 6:19:50 PM - monerobull[m]: Btw do you guys want plushies or not?
10/29/2022, 6:20:32 PM - msvb-web: We can probably use floorspace in the Bordel (La Fabrica basement) for a few weeks of storage.
10/29/2022, 6:21:36 PM - monerobull[m]: > <@monerobull:matrix.org> Btw do you guys want plushies or not?

10/29/2022, 6:22:31 PM - ajs_[m]: i think so
10/29/2022, 6:23:08 PM - ajs_[m]: you can add a comment about the item in the merch issue
10/29/2022, 6:23:24 PM - monerobull[m]: I did under swag
10/29/2022, 6:23:49 PM - ajs_[m]: monerobull: okay
10/29/2022, 6:24:36 PM - ajs_[m]: i think we can order a few to giveaway
10/29/2022, 6:25:17 PM - ajs_[m]: msvb-web: what do you think about setting a deadline for a response from La Fabrica? it looks like our friends in Neuchâtel are keen in moving forward with planning
10/29/2022, 6:26:01 PM - monerobull[m]: > <@ajs_:matrix.org> i think we can order a few to giveaway

I'm ordering 100 for my shop, how many should i have made to give away? They cost me about 20$ per piece 
10/29/2022, 6:26:17 PM - ajs_[m]: i don't know yet
10/29/2022, 6:26:50 PM - ajs_[m]: once we start budgeting for merch
10/29/2022, 6:27:18 PM - monerobull[m]: I think you have 1-2 months to decide, it's not that pressing 
10/29/2022, 6:29:05 PM - monerobull[m]: I can't quite remember, did i pledge to be program chair last time?
10/29/2022, 6:29:05 PM - ajs_[m]: on the U.S. option, I think we can drop it
10/29/2022, 6:29:50 PM - ajs_[m]: i think you mentioned that you would be open to it if no once else takes on the role
10/29/2022, 6:29:56 PM - ajs_[m]: i reached out to doug and sunita regarding monerotopia
10/29/2022, 6:30:12 PM - monerobull[m]: They are doing it in Mexico this time
10/29/2022, 6:30:39 PM - ajs_[m]: they are considering doing something in Spring either in mexico or Miami 
10/29/2022, 6:31:03 PM - monerobull[m]: Tweeted it's Mexico like 2 hours ago
10/29/2022, 6:31:20 PM - monerobull[m]: I'll be back in 5 min 
10/29/2022, 6:32:51 PM - ajs_[m]: so since they are covering that side of the ocean, do you think we should go ahead and drop the Houston option for monerokon?
10/29/2022, 6:34:21 PM - monerobull[m]: Sounds like a plan
10/29/2022, 6:34:24 PM - ajs_[m]: okay
10/29/2022, 6:34:41 PM - monerobull[m]: My friends probably couldn't make it to the US so I'm biased
10/29/2022, 6:36:13 PM - ajs_[m]: so let's set a deadline for a response for La Fabrica, if hear nothing from them by next meeting, we'll move on
10/29/2022, 6:37:27 PM - ajs_[m]: AOB?
10/29/2022, 6:37:39 PM - monerobull[m]: What?
10/29/2022, 6:38:04 PM - ajs_[m]: any other business
10/29/2022, 6:38:04 PM - monerobull[m]: Any other business?
10/29/2022, 6:38:04 PM - monerobull[m]: Ah ok
10/29/2022, 6:38:50 PM - monerobull[m]: So far i haven't done much besides attending meetings, i guess i can do program chair if nobody else cares for it. I'd start after we have a location, right?
10/29/2022, 6:39:09 PM - ajs_[m]: yeah
10/29/2022, 6:39:15 PM - ajs_[m]: okay, next meeting two weeks from now... same time
10/29/2022, 6:39:34 PM - ajs_[m]: thanks everyone
10/29/2022, 6:39:38 PM - ajs_[m]: have a nice weekend
