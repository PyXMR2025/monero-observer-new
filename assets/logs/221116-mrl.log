17:00:39 <UkoeHB> meeting time https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/755
17:00:39 <UkoeHB> 1. greetings
17:00:39 <UkoeHB> hello
17:00:42 <vtnerd> hi
17:00:56 <rehrar> hi
17:01:13 <M0xtraffikriot[m> hi!
17:01:14 <rbrunner> Hello
17:01:54 <Rucknium[m]> Hi
17:01:57 <UkoeHB> Rucknium[m]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/735
17:03:04 <Rucknium[m]> UkoeHB: That's the version with the error in the appendix. We can return to that later.
17:03:29 <UkoeHB> that's the version with an appendix lol
17:03:52 <UkoeHB> 2. updates, what's everyone working on?
17:04:36 <vtnerd> my serialization changes/branch have been _basically_ completed, including replacement of the different ZeroMQ json implementation
17:04:50 <vtnerd> only a few functional_rpc tests remain before issuing a pr
17:06:06 <UkoeHB> me: have been sick, otherwise working on finishing touches for multisig + refactoring the library into multiple directories (half done); after that is just the coinbase tx type
17:06:18 <vtnerd> https://github.com/vtnerd/monero/tree/replace_p2p_serialization2 is the locaiton
17:06:24 <Rucknium[m]> me: Familiarizing myself with previous BulletProofs+ audit process. I asked Diego Salazar from Cypherstack to be available for this meeting so we can discuss details of the BP++ audit CCS.
17:06:34 <rehrar> das me
17:07:30 <vtnerd> so it looks like someone audited the paper, and you are preparing for an audit of the yet-to-be-written bp++? or perhaps somene is writing that already
17:07:45 <UkoeHB> vtnerd: https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/101
17:08:35 <vtnerd> I ah yeah we definitely discussed that, and I forgot initially
17:08:58 <vtnerd> although Im a bit worried that we may need to re/write ? eh whatever it'll get done
17:09:09 <UkoeHB> rewrite the bp++ paper?
17:09:32 <vtnerd> no that mysterious implementation lol
17:09:35 <selsta> we will have to write the code ourselves
17:09:40 <UkoeHB> oh definitely
17:09:53 <vtnerd> yeah thats fine, there's a few people that can do it around
17:09:54 <UkoeHB> 3. let's move to discussion
17:10:24 <Rucknium[m]> We could perhaps reduce confusion by calling what CypherStack will do a "Peer review" rather than "audit".
17:10:38 <Rucknium[m]> Since they are not auditing any code at this point
17:10:48 <UkoeHB> part of the work requested from CypherStack https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/358 is a proof of concept
17:11:16 <Rucknium[m]> Yes but you cannot audit code you've written yourself
17:11:45 <rehrar> As far as I was aware, the PoC wasn't to be included, but rather was to be used more or less as a benchmarking tool since the other implementation can't be verified.
17:11:54 <plowsof> PoC not yet discussed/finalised/confirmed, only 1a) is covered in that ccs* 
17:12:12 <UkoeHB> ok then take it off the ccs if it's not included...
17:12:13 <rehrar> So we would be doing two pieces of work. A peer review of the paper, and a PoC of the code for benchmarking purposes and comparison to BP+ so see if it's worth inclusion.
17:12:22 <UkoeHB> now I'm frustrated
17:12:43 <rbrunner> "with only (1a) being set in stone / to be achieved by this C" from the CCS
17:13:43 <rehrar> We're obviously happy to do the PoC as well, pending the results of the peer review.
17:13:56 <rbrunner> Yeah, maybe put that proposed total timeline somewhere else, so that the CCS text is single-topic without any room for doubt
17:14:02 <UkoeHB> rehrar: would that be an additional funding round?
17:14:27 <rehrar> yes
17:14:33 <plowsof> got it rbrunner 
17:15:09 <plowsof> we can't raise funds for a proof of concept until the paper is audited? or am i totlaly off base here
17:15:45 <selsta> I'm not convinced how useful a PoC is, unless it's required as a template for the real implementation.
17:15:56 <UkoeHB> selsta: yes that's why I requested it
17:15:56 <rbrunner> Well, maybe the whole BP++ comes crashing down in that peer review, worst case
17:15:57 <rehrar> I mean, in theory both can be raised at once, and if something is found to be terribly wrong with the paper (unlikely), then we just don't do the PoC and the money goes to the GF.
17:15:57 <selsta> The author has a proof of concept on git already.
17:16:58 <plowsof> then we need to foamlise the scope of this PoC because there was 2 things going on - simply 'benchmarking in c++' (instead of haskell) and then creating something thats 'actually' usable for monero libraries
17:17:05 <plowsof> formalise*
17:19:04 <UkoeHB> selsta: ok if someone who can read haskell or whatever that is wants to translate it to python/c++...
17:19:16 <rbrunner> Why Haskell? What is now in Haskell? The author's PoC?
17:19:40 <UkoeHB> https://github.com/Liam-Eagen/BulletproofsPP
17:19:53 <vtnerd> lol I've always secretly loved haskell ... Im not sure if signing myself up for this is a good idea given other stuff Im doing
17:19:59 <vtnerd> but maybe this is more important
17:20:10 <rbrunner> Oh wow
17:20:16 <vtnerd> and I havent studied haskell in depth, just like what they are trying to do
17:21:27 <vtnerd> the tasks Im trying to do are the p2p serialization and p2p e2e encryption
17:21:37 <vtnerd> and few other side things, but those are the most relevant to monero
17:21:48 <UkoeHB> vtnerd: what timeline do you have for those p2p things?
17:21:51 <vtnerd> *the above is the most relevant to this discussion
17:21:55 <selsta> p2p serialization is the one that's almost finished?
17:22:17 <rbrunner> This goes over my head, but the "P" in "PoC" stands for "proof", and maybe we don't need any more proof and could directly go to the implementation in Monero codebase
17:22:18 <vtnerd> yes. and the p2p encryption has some code but I stopped dead in my tracks because of the tracking issue with the initial proposal
17:22:35 <UkoeHB> a big advantage of getting the code done in-house is we can ask cypherstack for a code audit in the future
17:22:46 <vtnerd> I've actually got to re-write my proposal on that, and follow closer to what bitcoin is doing (I think), but theres a few other details I've got to work through
17:23:20 <vtnerd> having a static-key is nice for a few reasons, but it makes the node trackable in a bunch of ways
17:23:37 <Rucknium[m]> AFAIK, we're not in a rush here on BP++. We can take things step by step. Probably the only downside to separating the peer review and PoC into two CCS proposals is asking the community twice to fund something.
17:23:52 <vtnerd> so Im still mulling over whether a --secret-p2p-key opti-in is a good idea 
17:24:12 <vtnerd> yeah bp++ seems like it would be more on the seraphis timeline ?
17:24:34 <rbrunner> We estimated Seraphis 2 years out, or longer
17:24:47 <vtnerd> like thats going to be a major fork anyway, and bp++ in the current mlsag/ringct setup is going to be annoying
17:25:14 <rbrunner> More annoying than BP+ then?
17:25:16 <vtnerd> I mean it would enable us to bump ringct further, but then we have maintenance on a bp++ w/mslag to think about
17:25:23 <selsta> is it different from going from bp to bp+?
17:25:43 <vtnerd> no its just that bp++ with mlsag adds additional technical debt that we have to maintain in perpuitity for the project
17:25:51 <UkoeHB> the sooner BP++ is done, the sooner resources tied to that project can be used elsewhere
17:26:27 <vtnerd> hmm. well I'll let the others decide whether is higher priority then
17:26:29 <UkoeHB> plus the longer it takes to integrate, the less available I may end up being
17:26:49 <vtnerd> it sounds like bp++ is high priority then
17:26:56 <rbrunner> Well, otherwise we have a larger-than-would-have-been blockchain for perpetuity, no?
17:27:13 <UkoeHB> yes, for me it's high priority
17:27:17 <vtnerd> yeah theres that angle too.
17:27:46 <vtnerd> ok, sounds like we need bp++ immediately then, if theres a haskell implementation Ill do a straight port
17:27:51 <rbrunner> 2 years without a hardfork are booring anyway :)
17:27:53 <plowsof> the 'peer review' is promised to be completed in 'around' 12 ~ days 
17:28:20 <UkoeHB> vtnerd: the BP++ author's proof of concept is here https://github.com/Liam-Eagen/BulletproofsPP
17:29:09 <vtnerd> one complication with perf comparisons is that the
