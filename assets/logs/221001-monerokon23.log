10/1/2022, 6:01:03 PM - ajs_: [1. greetings](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/735)
10/1/2022, 6:01:19 PM - ajs_: https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/735
10/1/2022, 6:01:32 PM - evolbit[m]: Yes, let's go. Hell all
10/1/2022, 6:01:39 PM - ajs_: hello
10/1/2022, 6:01:42 PM - evolbit[m]: * Yes, let's go. Hello all
10/1/2022, 6:01:48 PM - msvb-web: Hello.
10/1/2022, 6:01:51 PM - monerobull: hi
10/1/2022, 6:04:23 PM - monerobull: i guess #2, ajs status update
10/1/2022, 6:05:19 PM - ajs_: i have been gathering more information and waiting for follow ups from contacts
10/1/2022, 6:05:32 PM - ajs_: i added two more venues in Houston
10/1/2022, 6:05:52 PM - ajs_: https://github.com/MoneroKon/meta/issues/1
10/1/2022, 6:06:09 PM - monerobull: so we still arent even sure about which continent to go with?
10/1/2022, 6:06:54 PM - evolbit[m]: I thought it would be on Europe...
10/1/2022, 6:07:33 PM - evolbit[m]: * I thought it would be in Europe...
10/1/2022, 6:07:47 PM - ajs_: yeah, i just wanted to have back up options if venues in Europe fall through
10/1/2022, 6:08:16 PM - ajs_: but if people want to focus on only Europe, we can drop them
10/1/2022, 6:08:46 PM - evolbit[m]: Yeah, it makes sense, moneroKon should happen anyway. You did well
10/1/2022, 6:10:26 PM - monerobull: role pledging update: technical Program Committee now has 4 pledges, i think thats enough
10/1/2022, 6:10:26 PM - dadajo: How are the locations choosen? 
10/1/2022, 6:12:03 PM - ajs_: dadajo: no specific method. if you have a contact or idea for a location you can propose it
10/1/2022, 6:12:31 PM - ajs_: i am from Houston, so I looked at possible locations there
10/1/2022, 6:13:10 PM - dadajo: Is there a list of requirements e.g. how many people can it host etc.?
10/1/2022, 6:13:20 PM - monerobull: ive just checked prices for flights, should be doable in case other locations fall through
10/1/2022, 6:13:58 PM - ajs_: monerobull: the more the better, it is a lot of work to go over presentation/workshop proposals
10/1/2022, 6:14:19 PM - dadajo: I don't know how wealthy the average monerokon attendee is but Switzerland is quite expensive...
10/1/2022, 6:15:01 PM - ajs_: we had over 40 for 2022 and narrow it down to 20-30
10/1/2022, 6:15:39 PM - dadajo: Last meeting msvb suggested that we vote next meeting which venue we shall choose. Is this still up to date?
10/1/2022, 6:16:10 PM - msvb-web: I think so.
10/1/2022, 6:16:13 PM - msvb-web: Praha is still half paused, with no major problems just the venue owner being quite busy.
10/1/2022, 6:16:19 PM - ajs_: we are still waiting on information from venues
10/1/2022, 6:17:12 PM - msvb-web: Prague is cheap compared to CH but the venue price could be more in Prague.
10/1/2022, 6:17:54 PM - ajs_: msvb-web: how probable we would be able to book Praha
10/1/2022, 6:17:59 PM - ajs_: 50%
10/1/2022, 6:18:07 PM - ajs_: 70%
10/1/2022, 6:18:11 PM - ajs_: 99%
10/1/2022, 6:18:20 PM - msvb-web: I made more efforts with the Prague venue today (where Seth and are currently sitting) but everyone is too busy managing the event happening now.
10/1/2022, 6:18:40 PM - evolbit[m]: Prague venue might bring more people to the event. There are a lot of crypto projects in the nearby countries who could get interested. But that's just my speculation 
10/1/2022, 6:18:49 PM - msvb-web: I think 80-90%.
10/1/2022, 6:19:41 PM - ajs_: okay, in that case perhaps we should focus on our efforts happening there then
10/1/2022, 6:20:13 PM - ajs_: Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has backed out of the offer
10/1/2022, 6:20:51 PM - msvb-web: It's quite difficult to make progress ajs_ but I agree. I had a long meeting with our Neuchâtel contacts yesterday and today as well.
10/1/2022, 6:21:02 PM - ajs_: and University of Neuchâtel has not provided enough information to consider if it is a viable location
10/1/2022, 6:21:26 PM - msvb-web: They are all on stage speaking and generally not well concentrated.
10/1/2022, 6:22:46 PM - ajs_: okay, we can wait another week or so before making a firm decision then
10/1/2022, 6:23:28 PM - ajs_: looking a the venue list, can we agree to drop KKL Luzern and the Houston options?
10/1/2022, 6:23:39 PM - msvb-web: The Neuchâtel contacts had their company retreat last week and only just made their flights to arrive in Praha late. Before that they were in Kiev, so that's why we are getting little information from Neuchâtel.
10/1/2022, 6:24:08 PM - dadajo: I can also check a couple backup options in berlin. I would have to contact and see prices... 
10/1/2022, 6:25:28 PM - ajs_: i sent email to c-base in berlin a few days ago, but i didn't get a response
10/1/2022, 6:25:57 PM - ajs_: msvb-web: okay
10/1/2022, 6:26:11 PM - dadajo: Ok good to know
10/1/2022, 6:26:21 PM - ajs_: drop KKL Luzern?
10/1/2022, 6:26:32 PM - ajs_: yes or no
10/1/2022, 6:28:43 PM - evolbit[m]: I vote yes
10/1/2022, 6:28:50 PM - msvb-web: I think yes, let's drop Luzern.
10/1/2022, 6:28:52 PM - monerobull: they dropped the xmr payments but are they completely out?
10/1/2022, 6:29:17 PM - ajs_: completely out
10/1/2022, 6:29:34 PM - dadajo: Yes
10/1/2022, 6:29:39 PM - monerobull: well then we should obviously drop them from the list
10/1/2022, 6:30:24 PM - ajs_: there was internal push back from the university that didn't want to associate with monero to protect their "brand"
10/1/2022, 6:31:06 PM - monerobull: lmao what
10/1/2022, 6:31:07 PM - monerobull: fuck them
10/1/2022, 6:33:06 PM - dadajo: So only houston and prague left on the venue list
10/1/2022, 6:33:23 PM - ajs_: and Neuchâtel
10/1/2022, 6:33:36 PM - ajs_: waiting for more details from them
10/1/2022, 6:34:08 PM - msvb-web: I think Florence needs to give details on Neuchâtel.
10/1/2022, 6:34:16 PM - ajs_: but my current preference is for prague
10/1/2022, 6:35:18 PM - monerobull: same for me
10/1/2022, 6:35:49 PM - msvb-web: Okay that's good for me to know, while I'm here.
10/1/2022, 6:35:59 PM - dadajo: Let's hope prague confirms. Shall we move to the next topic?
10/1/2022, 6:36:00 PM - ajs_: i think we can also drop Topgolf option.. little expensive for $30k
10/1/2022, 6:36:42 PM - dadajo: 👍
10/1/2022, 6:37:46 PM - ajs_: okay
10/1/2022, 6:38:22 PM - ajs_: so we wait for more details from prague and neuchâtel before moving on
10/1/2022, 6:38:30 PM - ajs_: AOB?
10/1/2022, 6:39:39 PM - ajs_: next meeting
10/1/2022, 6:40:00 PM - ajs_: are we good for setting it in two weeks, same time
10/1/2022, 6:40:03 PM - ajs_: Saturday 15th October 2022 @ 18:00 UTC
10/1/2022, 6:40:25 PM - dadajo: Yes
10/1/2022, 6:40:58 PM - evolbit[m]: All good
10/1/2022, 6:41:04 PM - monerobull: sure
10/1/2022, 6:41:33 PM - msvb-web: Any messages for the HCPP boss? She is sitting next to me recovering.
10/1/2022, 6:41:41 PM - msvb-web: Or questions for her?
10/1/2022, 6:43:18 PM - ajs_: just that i hope for speedy recovery
10/1/2022, 6:43:37 PM - ajs_: okay
10/1/2022, 6:43:58 PM - ajs_: thanks everyone for joining the meeting. have a nice weekend
