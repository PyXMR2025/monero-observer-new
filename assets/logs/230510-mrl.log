17:00:14 <UkoeHB> meeting time https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/834
17:00:14 <UkoeHB> 1. greetings
17:00:14 <UkoeHB> hello
17:00:17 <vtnerd_> hi
17:00:58 <Rucknium[m]> Hi
17:03:29 <Rucknium[m]> I think the bridge is awake now.
17:03:59 <UkoeHB> low attendance today, will be a short meeting
17:04:06 <UkoeHB> 2. updates?
17:04:40 <UkoeHB> me: attended monerotopia
17:05:17 <Rucknium[m]> I presented "A Statistical Research Agenda for Monero" at Monerotopia.
17:05:17 <Rucknium[m]> Here are the slides: https://github.com/Rucknium/presentations/blob/main/Rucknium-Monerotopia-2023-Slides.pdf
17:05:34 <Rucknium[m]> If you want to hear a decent but unenthusiastic synthesized voice: https://vimeo.com/824376532
17:05:34 <Rucknium[m]> The video presentation doesn't add a whole lot compared to just reading the slides.
17:05:54 <vtnerd_> mention tx_extra again lol
17:05:54 <vtnerd_> or maybe I shouldn't have said even that
17:06:14 <Rucknium[m]> Maybe I should have titled it "Trustless zk-SNARKs aren't battle-tested + A Statistical Research Agenda for Monero"
17:07:54 <vtnerd_> I didn't get as much done on bp++ as I would've hoped :/
17:08:29 <vtnerd_> one problem I have is Ive promised too many things, I think, as Im now getting pressured to do LWS stuff for a small fee (pushing back hard on this at the moment)
17:09:36 <vtnerd_> but I'll try to wrap my head around this yet, whats intriguing is the c and rust implementation of bp++ appear to do variable bases, not sure why they didnt fix them to one
17:10:06 <UkoeHB> thanks guys
17:10:11 <UkoeHB> 3. discussion
17:10:22 <UkoeHB> I have no topic to discuss
17:11:42 <vtnerd_> I guess no one does then
17:12:06 <Rucknium[m]> I have been considering compdec 's (Nathan Borggren) research proposal about EAE-like attacks posted earlier this week in this channel.  Borggren already co-authored two short papers about Monero's potential privacy problems: 
17:12:11 <Rucknium[m]> Borggren & Yao (2020) "Correlations of multi-input Monero transactions."
17:12:11 <Rucknium[m]> Borggren, Kim, Yao, & Koplik (2020). "Simulated blockchains for machine learning traceability and transaction values in the Monero network."
17:12:29 <sgp[m]> hello, sorry I'm late
17:13:14 <Rucknium[m]> I am not familiar at all with one of the main techniques (Topological Data Analysis) proposed in the proposal. That limits the feedback and analysis I can give.
17:13:41 <Rucknium[m]> Overall, it looks like a strong proposal.
17:16:28 <Rucknium[m]> Some feedback:
17:17:45 <Rucknium[m]> 1) We need clear straight lines connecting the methodologies to an attacker's objective: determining the false positive and false negative rate of guessing in an EAE-like attack. 
17:17:58 <Rucknium[m]> 2) Using transaction uniformity defects would be useful, but may be a distraction from the main research question.
17:17:59 <Rucknium[m]> 3) Doing a testnet set of transactions probably will be harder and just as useful as simulating simple data directly with Python, R, or something like that.
17:18:09 <Rucknium[m]> The Matrix-IRC bridge maintenance was supposed to be finished by now.
17:18:57 <Rucknium[m]> In case contact is lost: https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-research-lab
17:19:51 <UkoeHB> thanks Rucknium[m] 
17:24:50 <UkoeHB> if that is all, we can call it for today
17:29:03 <UkoeHB> thanks for attending guys
