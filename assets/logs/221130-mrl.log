17:00:42 <UkoeHB> meeting time https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/760
17:00:42 <UkoeHB> 1. greetings
17:00:42 <UkoeHB> hello
17:00:55 <one-horse-wagon[> Hello.
17:01:01 <ghostway[m]> Hello
17:01:03 <rbrunner> Hello
17:01:40 <vtnerd> hi
17:02:13 <dangerousfreedom> Hello
17:03:10 <UkoeHB> 2. updates, what's everyone working on?
17:03:34 <UkoeHB> me: started my big cleanup/review pass on the seraphis library
17:03:55 <jberman[m]> hello
17:04:32 <vtnerd> working on getting my machines together / bp++
17:04:55 <UkoeHB> vtnerd: does the haskell -> C++ translation seem doable?
17:05:15 <Rucknium[m]> Hi
17:05:53 <vtnerd> eh I dunno yet sadly, too focused on IT stuff. I'll message you privately by friday
17:06:07 <UkoeHB> ok thanks
17:06:14 <vtnerd> haskell is a bit different, but I should be able to pick up the language
17:08:17 <UkoeHB> it seems the matrix<->irc bridge is dead
17:08:37 <UkoeHB> can read along here as an interim solution: https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-research-lab/20221130
17:08:54 <UkoeHB> nvm that one doesn't see matrix stuff when the bridge is dead..
17:09:48 <koe000[m]> is the bridge dead?
17:10:31 <Rucknium[m]> Matrix<>IRC bridge seems laggy. Maybe it's just my Matrix home server.
17:10:51 <koe000[m]> matrix users can read along here: https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-research-lab/20221130
17:11:05 <one-horse-wagon[> Shouldn't we all just move to Matrix and be done with it?
17:12:13 <selsta> one-horse-wagon[: no :D
17:12:22 <koe000[m]> no
17:12:27 <selsta> anyway that's not a good topic for the meeting
17:12:34 <rbrunner> :)
17:12:35 <UkoeHB> looks like a 3min lag...
17:12:50 <UkoeHB> and matrix is not reading IRC
17:13:14 <UkoeHB> going to be a short meeting
17:13:20 <UkoeHB> 3. discussion, anything to discuss?
17:13:22 <Rucknium[m]> ghostway was the straw that broke the bridge's back. N+1 Matrix users. ;)
17:13:22 <plowsof> hi
17:13:22 <koe000[m]> anyway, do matrix users have any updates to give? looks like IRC is picking up messages 2-3 minutes late
17:14:15 <plowsof> im waiting on a progress update from the BP++ author (for the new paper)
17:14:31 <jberman> late update: I've been working through stress testing the pool and doing a final review on 8076, hoping to be done by end of week
17:14:35 <ghostway[m]> Rucknium[m]: Lol
17:14:56 <ghostway[m]> No progress on irc as well..
17:15:50 <ghostway[m]> I can set up monero irc if this is blocking 
17:15:59 <koe000[m]> thanks plowsof
17:16:13 <Rucknium[m]> No substantial updates. The only feedback I received on the public OSPEAD plan so far was from a Reddit user who asked if OSPEAD tries to account for a possible ongoing flooding a.k.a. black marble attack.
17:16:14 <Rucknium[m]> The answer is no it does not. But further research on that could happen, outside of the scope of the current OSPEAD CCS.
17:16:15 <koe000[m]> 1 week sounded pretty ambitious for him, such things always take longer than expected
17:16:54 <Rucknium[m]> Any feedback can be placed here: https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/93
17:18:02 <UkoeHB> does anyone have comments on the account id discussion that starts here: https://gist.github.com/tevador/50160d160d24cfc6c52ae02eb3d17024?permalink_comment_id=4379590#gistcomment-4379590 ?
17:19:58 <rbrunner> Some sort of meta comment, I asked myself what to do if our two prominent cryptographers have different opinions, and consensus seems elusive
17:20:55 <rbrunner> But I don't have a good answer. Maybe trying to get comments from kabayanerve, luigi, knaccc as well?
17:21:31 <jberman> I have a question, can you elaborate on this: "user wallets like the CLI can only support around 6 bits worth of account ids (64) before the UX degrades seriously" -> why do you see this as the case? Seems to be the basis for dividing modes via user mode/automated and I'm not seeing exactly why such division would be desirable
17:21:42 <jberman> UkoeHB^
17:21:51 <UkoeHB> so the CLI can support 65k accounts?
17:21:54 <UkoeHB> how does that UX work?
17:22:01 <rbrunner> Ah, it's kayabaNerve
17:24:03 <jberman> I don't believe accounts are paginated when listing them, nor transfers when listing them, but I don't see why the UX *has* to be poor in that circumstance. I.e. why not just have one mode that cleanly handles a large number
17:24:56 <jberman> So long as there is a mode which supports a large number
17:25:44 <UkoeHB> My point is the CLI and similar wallets are all manual-interface-oriented. You aren't going to manually manage more than ~64 accounts from the CLI or a phone app, you're going to use a more enterprise-level wallet.
17:27:16 <UkoeHB> even if the CLI figures out a UX that works, other wallets can't really be expected to all support 'big account set' mode
17:27:25 <jberman> I follow. Yea, that's fair
17:27:37 <rbrunner> Sometimes known as "You can't optimize for everything at the same time" :)
17:27:52 <Rucknium[m]> Maybe the bridge slowdown is retaliation from Matrix.org for slyly bridging #monero
17:28:33 <ghostway[m]> About the discussion there, why would the ux degrade? You could have names for them and identifiers that map to some bytes
17:28:37 <rbrunner> Hell, some wallets don't support account *at all* to this day?
17:29:28 <UkoeHB> rbrunner: right, and that reflects the baseline 'no accounts only indices mode'
17:29:57 <rbrunner> ghostway[m]: I think a discussion "Is an UX possible" misses the point. Of course it is.
17:30:40 <rbrunner> The argument was there are (at least) two important groups of users that may use accounts in substantially different ways. At least I see the argument that way.
17:30:47 <UkoeHB> ghostway[m]: the simplest UX is 'list your accounts and click on the one you want to access' - that because a tedious burden for large numbers of accounts
17:31:31 <rbrunner> One the one hand you and me with a handful of accounts. On the other side Binance with a 10,000-account wallet, who knows.
17:31:51 <rbrunner> We don't really need a system that covers both.
17:32:16 <rbrunner> They won't manage their wallet with the CLI wallet.
17:33:55 <ghostway[m]> Aha
17:37:15 <UkoeHB> ghostway[m]: not consensus, but there are some proposals to embed account ids in the jamtis specification
17:37:29 <UkoeHB> anyway, are there any other topics to discuss today?
17:38:17 <rbrunner> Maybe now that bridge crashed for good - or is restarting?
17:39:45 <nioc> rbrunner: what you see is happening in other channels as well
17:41:21 <tevador> Jamtis address checksum proposal: https://gist.github.com/tevador/50160d160d24cfc6c52ae02eb3d17024?permalink_comment_id=4382275#gistcomment-4382275
17:43:25 <rbrunner> Can't judge that for lack of knowledge, but I do hope we can use that soon with good confidence. Would be nice to have Jamtis addresses fixed.
17:43:33 <UkoeHB> I don't really have an opinion on the checksum
17:45:29 <rbrunner> My question to tevador basically was "Can we trust that particular polynomial" here: https://github.com/seraphis-migration/wallet3/issues/37#issuecomment-1329217733
17:45:42 <ghostway[m]> Polynomial checksums seem to be having an issue, but I think it's not something that needs to be discussed now when there's no data about it. So my opinion if any, is to have some tests run on it in the background
17:45:43 <rbrunner> And their answer looks convincing to me.
17:47:16 <tevador> I'm still planning to run some tests on the "M" constant.
17:47:24 <rbrunner> Didn't gingeropolous say something about that infrastructure? Maybe we can run those "35 billion polymod evaluations" there :)
17:47:40 <UkoeHB> tevador: can you document the tests you run so they can be reproduced?
17:47:54 <Rucknium[m]> Reminder: if we want to do a search for good parameters, gingeropolous maintains a research computing server for us.
17:48:05 <rbrunner> Yes, that!
17:48:11 <tevador> Yes, would be great if a more powerful machine was available for that. The generator search took me 3 days with 16 cores.
17:48:43 <ghostway[m]> Tomorrow I can write polymod in c++/rust, if you want
17:48:55 <ghostway[m]> Seems like the bridge is working now
17:48:56 <Rucknium[m]> "64-thread Threadripper CPU" is what the research computing server has
17:49:04 <                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
