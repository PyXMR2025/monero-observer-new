> Had some personal issues that set me back a bit this month. I am rebasing Penumbra on latest Haveno source as some of the issues have been resolved upstream (RPC issues, UI issues, latest multisig code). Performance should be a bit better too. Bounties will be redistributed to issues not solved by upstream and relevant only to Penumbras structure.
