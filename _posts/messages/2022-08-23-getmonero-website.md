**Monero Observer is not in any way connected/affiliated with `getmonero.website`.**

It has recently come to my attention that `getmonero.website` has been using Monero Observer content without respecting any of the license terms (CC BY-SA 4.0).

The website is not giving appropriate credit and there is no indication if any changes were made to the original reports.

Furthermore, the domain name is rather similar to the official `getmonero.org` website.

I will update this message if anything changes.
