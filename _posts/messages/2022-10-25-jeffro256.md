> Right now, if you would like to be a volunteer community node operator (we can filter out later), please post a maximum of 1 network address per network (IPv4, IPv6, Tor, or I2P) that would be available. For each IPv4 or IPv6 address, also post an SSL certificate generated by monero-gen-ssl-cert. If you have a PGP key in the repo, and you would like to sign with that, that would be appreciated.
