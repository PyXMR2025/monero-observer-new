> During a community meeting 3 months ago, it was decided to withold mj's partial payment of milestone 3 (MS3) in the best interests of the community. [..] Now that mj has completed their part of MS3+4 / endor requires no further help / their working relationship is over - reasons for withholding MS3 (and now MS4) may need to be reevaluated. I will make a decision on how to proceed by this the 17th (Saturday) given your feedback and/or votes.
