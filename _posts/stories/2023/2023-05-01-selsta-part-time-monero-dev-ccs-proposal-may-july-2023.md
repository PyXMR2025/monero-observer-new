selsta[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of July 2023:

> Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months (from May to end of July) at a rate of 45€ / hour. At 138.5€ / XMR this makes 117 XMR.

```
Total funding: 117 XMR.

ETA: (end of) July 2023.
```

The developer will start the planning of a network upgrade with *Bulletproofs++* and *RandomX* changes[^3], testing and reviewing PR's, Monero release engineering and other smaller dev work on the CLI and GUI.

selsta has contributed over 628 merged commits to both the CLI[^4] and GUI[^5] codebases since 2018.

You can post your comments and support this proposal on Gitlab in !386[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: moved to funding stage[^6].**
