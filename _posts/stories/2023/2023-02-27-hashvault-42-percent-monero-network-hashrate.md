HashVault.pro[^1] is now in control of ~42% of the total Monero network hashrate: ~1.5 GH/s / ~3.54 GH/s.  

Similar spikes were registered at the beginning of the month, as previously reported[^2]. It looks like the same miner[^3] is responsible for today's activity.

P2Pool’s HR is down ~3.5% for the day.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/2/28: hashrate back to 'normal' <600 MH/s levels; discussion thread available[^4].**

**Update 23/3/10: '1GH/s miner' is back and HV now controls ~58% of the total network hashrate[^5].**

**Update 23/3/11: HR back to 'normal' ~650 MH/s levels again.**
