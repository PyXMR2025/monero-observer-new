CM-IV[^1] has submitted his first ever CCS proposal[^2] looking to fund the implementation of *Oceanus Enterprise Resource Planning*[^3] XMR software for small businesses:

> Oceanus ERP is terminal-based software that a small business or organization owner could use in order to handle daily business activies. [..] The unique feature .. will be its ability to accept and process Monero payments using either the Moneropay API or the AcceptXMR library

```
Total funding: 80 XMR.

ETA: <2 months.
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: Client Management (12 XMR)
- M2: Project Management (12 XMR)
- M3: Service Management (12 XMR)
- M4: Invoice Management (22 XMR)
- M5: Manage Monero Payments (22 XMR)
