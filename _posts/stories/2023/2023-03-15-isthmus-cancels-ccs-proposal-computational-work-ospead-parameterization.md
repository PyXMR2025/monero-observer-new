Isthmus[^1] has temporarily cancelled[^2] his CCS funding proposal[^3] to do *computational work for OSPEAD parameterization*, after deciding to complete most of the work *at no cost*:

> Hello everyone, just a brief update. I've decided to carry out much of this work on my own time, at no cost. To avoid confusion, I'll be closing this CCS for now, but I might reopen it or create a new one if circumstances change. Thank you all again for your valuable input and support :)

The proposal was discussed on GitLab in !375[^4] and during the past two *-community* meetings[^5]'[^6]. 

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
