BigmenPixel[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to continue maintaining the Monero GUI flatpak package (*org.getmonero.Monero*[^3]) for 1 year, and obtain the *verified app*[^4] status on Flathub[^5]:

> I have been maintaining org.getmonero.Monero on Flathub since July 2021. Now I want to move its manifest to the monero-gui repository. After that, I will also give the application the verified status on Flathub. [..] 1 year of maintenance to be paid after performance review ..

```
Total funding: 10 XMR.

ETA: 12 months.
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: manifest to core repo + verified status (3.5 XMR)
- M2: 1 year maintenance (6.5 XMR)

The proposal comes days after Whonix founder adrelanos[^6] confirmed[^7] that he has no plans to submit an *extension request* for his expired CCS[^8], and recommended using the *official Monero flatpak installation method*[^9] instead.

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !381[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/3/30: CCS *on hold* due to *technical difficulties*.**

**Update 23/4/15: proposal moved to funding stage[^10].**
