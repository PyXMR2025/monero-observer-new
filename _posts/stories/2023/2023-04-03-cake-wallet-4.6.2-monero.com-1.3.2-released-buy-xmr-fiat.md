Cake Labs[^1] has released *Cake Wallet* v4.6.2 and *Monero.com* v1.3.2[^2] with support for direct XMR purchases with fiat (debit cards and other local payment methods) in *most countries* via *Payfura*[^3]:

> As a privacy first wallet we are excited to announce that we have added the ability to directly purchase Monero from inside the mobile app! This excludes USA for now and does require an ID.[^4]

### Changes overview

```
- Directly buy XMR with fiat in most countries (not USA for now, but you can buy BTC/LTC)
- Create invoices and donation links in the receive screen with Trocador AnonPay
- Bug fixes and minor app improvements
```

Consult the Github repository[^2] to verify and download the wallet APKs.

Note that Monero.com[^5] (iOS[^6], Android[^7]) is a Monero-only wallet and Cake Wallet[^8] (iOS[^9], Android[^10]) is a multi-coin wallet.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
