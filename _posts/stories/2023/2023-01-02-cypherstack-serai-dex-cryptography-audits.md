Serai DEX[^1] has announced[^2] that CypherStack[^3] started auditing their cryptography libraries[^4]:

> We've officially begun the audit of our #cryptography libraries! [..] We're lucky enough to have CypherStack performing our audits. [..] After our cryptography is audited, we plan to have our #Monero $XMR transaction library, completely written in Rust, audited next [..]

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^5] and join *#serai* on Matrix[^6] to learn more and get involved with the project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: audit completed, report available[^7].**
