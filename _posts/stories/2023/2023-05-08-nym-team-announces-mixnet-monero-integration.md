The Nym team[^1] has announced[^2] a new mixnet integration with the Monero network[^3] during the MoneroTopia 2023[^4] conference in Mexico City:

> This allows Monero users to easily use NymConnect to run Monero over the mixnet, thereby enhancing the privacy of Monero transactions.

To learn more about Nym and the NymConnect interface, consult the official documentation[^5]'[^6].

The Monero community is currently discussing Nym's questionable business model in *#monero-community*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: the Nym team is also scheduled to hold a talk during the upcoming MoneroTalk conference on June 24th[^8].**
