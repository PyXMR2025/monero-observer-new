pluja[^1] has decided[^2] to temporarily delist *MajesticBank*[^3] from the reputable *KYCNOT.me*[^4] website, after users started reporting issues[^5]'[^6]'[^7] with the platform:

> I have delisted Majestic Bank from kycnot.me until this issue gets clarified and/or solved and their services get back up.

The instant exchange apparently went down for a *DEX update* ~1 week ago, on March 17th[^8] and their latest announcement was posted on Telegram on March 19th[^9]:

> I can estimate that there is 6 more hours left before exchange is fully operational [..]

Last year in August MajesticBank was criticized after their subdread and main admin account were wiped *without any explanation* and the Dread staff urged *nobody use* the exchange, as previously reported[^10].

MajesticBank currently still remains listed as an official Monero Project[^11], Haveno[^12], and MoneroKon23 sponsor[^13], a MAGIC Monero Fund committee member[^14], and is integrated into Stack Wallet[^15].

*Note: MajesticBank was added to the Monero Observer Blacklist[^16].*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/3/27: the MajesticBank Telegram account posted a new message today: *'I am here to assist with any exchange until Monday when we are fully operational'*[^17]; the MB Matrix accounts were apparently deleted (thanks ofrnxmr[^18] for the ping).**

**Update 23/3/28: MB started posting new messages in #monero-site[^19]: *'There is no scam involved, we are doing upgrades and should be back shortly [..] the friend on the reddit tried a 0.25 xmr swap which was barely possible to be created with exchange in maintenance mode'*.**

**Update 23/3/31: KYCNOT.me relisted MajesticBank (domains are back up)[^20].**

**Update 23/4/18: according to MajesticBank statement, their *nodes were under heavy attack mostly coming from tor network*; a guide for preventing *unwanted traffic hitting the monerod* was posted on Github[^21].**
