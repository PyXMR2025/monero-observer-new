tevador[^1] has released a security advisory[^2] notifying the community of a *medium severity* vulnerability in Monero wallets that can be exploited by malicious remote nodes:

> The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (medium severity). **The impact of the exploit is more than just privacy loss, but the attacker cannot steal Monero from your wallet.** I recommend to stop using 3rd party remote nodes immediately. Run your own node instead. If you can't avoid using a 3rd party node, make sure you trust the node operator.

The vulnerability was first reported in January 2023 on HackerOne[^3], but apparently there is no *easy way* to fix it.

Although no patch will be provided by the Monero developers, tevador did propose a *small change to the PoW algorithm* that would give *better security for wallets using untrusted remote nodes*[^4].

We can expect the full details of the vulnerability to be disclosed *soon*. Until then, it is recommended to stop using 3rd party remote nodes and run your own node if possible, or at least connect to a *trusted* node operator.

*Note: tevador exposed the vulnerability to the public after 90 days, per Monero's VRP 'Post-release disclosure process'[^5].*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
