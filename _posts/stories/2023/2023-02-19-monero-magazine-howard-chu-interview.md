In this Monero Magazine[^1] episode[^2], host Michael Fitzgerald[^3] interviews *RandomX*[^4] developer Howard Chu[^5]:

> [..] you can talk about attacks on deanonymizing the transactions historically [..] I suppose that's the most fruitful point of attack, because the blockchain is forever, so 10 years from now you could be developing a technique to deanonymize the transactions from today .. (Howard @ 13:11)

Several topics are covered in this short interview, including Monero's mining design, miner decentralization, the concept behind RandomX, mining attack vectors, and Monero scaling.
