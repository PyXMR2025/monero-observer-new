Matt (mjg-foundation[^1]), a firmware engineer working at Foundation Devices[^2], has proposed several bounties[^3] for adding Monero support to an unofficial fork[^4] of the *Passport*[^5] BTC hardware wallet:

> I went ahead and set up a fork of @FOUNDATIONdvcs, with some initial issues and bounties [..] I don't intend to work very directly on this myself, but to facilitate devs who are more familiar with monero.[^6]'[^7]

### Bounties overview

```
- Monero Icons (0.2 XMR)
- Mobile Wallet with Airgapped Signing (2 XMR)
- Create Monero Seeds (4 XMR)
- Verify Addresses (1.5 XMR)
- Sign Monero Transactions (4 XMR)
- Multisig Support (1 XMR)
```

donttracemebruh[^8] has already boosted some of the bounties, and Foundation's *Head of Content* Sethforprivacy was also interested[^9] in pledging some XMR. 

The Monero community is currently discussing this story on *r/monero*[^10] and in *#monero-community*[^11].

*Note that the Monero firmware is not officially associated, endorsed, tested, or approved by Foundation Devices.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
