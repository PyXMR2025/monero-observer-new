The Trocador.app[^1] exchange aggregator has announced[^2] a new partnership with LocalMonero[^3]:

> Hey guys, Trocador's team is happy to announce we have partnered with LocalMonero in order to offer users the ability to buy Monero from LocalMonero sellers via Trocador.

This integration allows Trocador users to buy XMR (fixed rate swaps) without the need to register a LocalMonero account. Selling Monero to LocalMonero buyers is currently not supported.

### Features overview

- You can buy any amount of Monero using Ethereum, Litecoin or Bitcoin
- There's no need to create a LocalMonero account
- Trocador will automatically ask for the seller's ETC/BTC/LTC address via chat
- Trocador will automatically mark the purchase as 'Paid' inside LocalMonero [..]

Trocador is also *evaluating the possibility of implementing other pairs* and will start offering *a small insurance* to all trades *next week*.

To learn more about Trocador, consult the previous Monero Observer reports[^4]'[^5]'[^6].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: Trocador started offering insurance on all trades[^7].**
