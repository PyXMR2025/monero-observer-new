uzern4m[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to conduct *preliminary research on writing a new Monero node in Rust* and release a report:

> I think we should slowly but surely start exploring the possibility of developping a Rust-written Monero node in the future. That's why I'm proposing this CCS. The goal is to release a report on the different reasons for why we should and why we shouldn't write a Rust written node.

```
Total funding: 6 XMR (€15/h, 50 hours total).

ETA: 2-3 weeks.
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: Released the report (6 XMR)

This is uzern4m's first CCS and they have *never talked with the monero community*.

It is unclear if this proposal is in any way connected to Boog90's recently closed CCS[^3] to build an alternative Monero node in Rust.

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !373[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/1/31: according to uzern4m's comment[^4], this proposal is not connected in any way to Boog90's CCS.** 

**Update 23/2/1: proposal closed by uzern4m: 'I'll come back later with a more precise CCS proposal'[^5].**

**Update 23/2/8: uzern4m (SyntheticBird45) started work on the *Cuprate* project, an experimental Monero node written in Rust[^6].**
