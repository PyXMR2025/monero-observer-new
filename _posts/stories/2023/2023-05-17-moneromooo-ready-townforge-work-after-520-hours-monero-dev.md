moneromooo-monero[^1] has completed[^2] his Monero dev work CCS proposal[^3], and is now planning to work on Townforge[^4] *for the foreseeable future*:

> The last bit of work I did in Monero to push me past the pledged 520 hours was investigation and mitigation of what looks to be a spam attack sending plenty of duplicate transactions in notifications through Tor. [..] I will not be opening a new CCS, and for the foreseeable future I'll be working on Townforge instead, my game-on-a-chain which is a Monero fork.

To learn more about moneromooo's blockchain based game, read the manual on *townforge.net*[^5].
