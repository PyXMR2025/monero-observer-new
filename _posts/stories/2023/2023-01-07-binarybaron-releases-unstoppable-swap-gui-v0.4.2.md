binarybaron[^1] has released version 0.4.3[^2] of *UnstoppableSwap*[^3], the XMR<>BTC atomic swaps GUI:

### Changes overview

```
Do not auto download update but just spawn pop up
Add AutoUpdater
Migrate unit tests to bdk upgrade (tx_lock)
Remove unnecessary conditions from MergedDbState type guard [..]
```

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4] to learn more about the associated CCS proposal[^5].

To support the development of UnstoppableSwap, you can transfer XMR to the project's donation address[^6].

*Note that this project is still in beta, and as always with experimental software, there is some risk (including loss of funds). Use at your own risk.*
