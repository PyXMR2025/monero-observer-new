Fierfek[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] looking to advertise Monero in Mexico City before the MoneroTopia 2023 conference[^3]:

> [..] I think that this proposal is fundamental for Monero in Latin America, to directly reach these niches that currently promulgate the values of freedom at the code level, but not at the level of decentralized money, and I see that if we manage to reach them before of MoneroTopia, we will attract many more people until the event is bursting with attendees curious to learn and understand Monero.

```
Total funding: 32.34 XMR.

ETA: 5 weeks.
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: Trip to Mexico (7.82 XMR)
- M2: Hotel and expenses (9.75 XMR)
- M3: Advertising design and printing (4.62 XMR)
- M4: Transportation and meetings (6.15 XMR)
- M5: Unforeseen additional expenses (4 XMR)

monerobull has pointed out[^4] that the proposal is *highly unlikely* to be merged and funded before its March 28th deadline, *even with full community support*.

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !380[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: proposal closed[^5].**
