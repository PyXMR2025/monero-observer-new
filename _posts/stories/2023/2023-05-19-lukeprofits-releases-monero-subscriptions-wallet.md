lukeprofits[^1] has announced[^2] the release of *Monero Subscriptions Wallet*[^3], an XMR wallet that automatically pays subscriptions:

> It is meant to be a side-wallet so it's not ever supposed to have a ton of money. Just enough to pay your monthly subscriptions. $10 for your VPN, $30 for some other software, whatever.[^4]

To support lukeprofits' work, you can make a one-time or a recurring XMR donation[^5].

Consult the previous Monero Observer report to learn more about the project[^6].

*Note: inspect the code before using, if you can read Python.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
