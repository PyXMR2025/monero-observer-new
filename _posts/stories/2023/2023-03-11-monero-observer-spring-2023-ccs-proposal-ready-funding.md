After community review, the Monero Observer CCS proposal for Spring 2023 has been moved to the next stage and is now ready for funding:

> I will continue to maintain Monero Observer (https://monero.observer) for the next 3 months (spring 2023): March, April and May.

```
Total funding needed: 39 XMR (100% funded by 15 contributions)
```
