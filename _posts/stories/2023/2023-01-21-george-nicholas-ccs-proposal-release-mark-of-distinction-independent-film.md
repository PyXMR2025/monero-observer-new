George Nicholas[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to release *Mark of distinction*[^3], an independent film featuring Monero:

> Monero is featured in 3 scenes. As background, the protagonist, MANUEL, has found a physical Monero coin that his father had stashed away for him before his disappearance [..] I self-funded the shoot and post-production (the budget was in the low six figures), which exhausted my personal savings. We need funds for the most crucial phase – the release of the film. This includes getting it in front of festivals and promoting it there, hiring a publicist, running an awards campaign.

```
Total funding: 154 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: upon approval (77 XMR)
- M2: upon qualifying for Academy Award (77 XMR)

George Nicholas was previously involved with making the *Monero Means Money*[^4] documentary film. Visit his *IMDb*[^5] profile to learn more about the filmmaker.
