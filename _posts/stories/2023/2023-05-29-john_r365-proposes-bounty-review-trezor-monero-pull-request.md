john_r365[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the review of a bugfix pull request (#8752[^3]) that was submitted by a *Trezor employed developer* (ph4r05[^4]) to the core Monero codebase in February:

> 2 and bit months on, it's still awaiting code review. [..] given Ledger's "issues" recently, and the lack of good, open-source alternatives I think Trezor is (for now) quite important to the ecosystem. So I think it might be worth incentivizing someone who is capable of reviewing that code. Hence this bounty.

```
Total Bounty: 1.265 XMR (to date)
```

Anyone can increase the bounty by transferring any XMR amount to the address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2].

Note that only devs that are *known to the community* and who have *previously proven capable of such a review* are eligible for this bounty.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
