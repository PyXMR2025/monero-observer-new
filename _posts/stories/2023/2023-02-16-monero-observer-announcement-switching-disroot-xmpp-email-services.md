Until further notice, *Disroot*[^1] will be the new primary XMPP and email service provider for Monero Observer due to prolonged technical issues with *Calyx Institute* (XMPP server connectivity issues) and *DNMX* (email delivery issues).

## Changes

- new main contact email address: escapethe3ra **at** disroot **dot** org
- new main contact XMPP address: escapethe3ra **at** disroot **dot** org

Verify the *[/contact-signed.txt](/contact-signed.txt)* file with my [GPG key](/3RA_pubkey.asc) and consult the [/about](/about#signature) page for more information.

Read the [Digitally signing contact information with GPG](/gpg-cleartext-signatures) guide if you need help verifying my accounts.

*Note: if contacting via email, try to manually encrypt your message if at all possible (hint: [CT-004: GPG encrypted communication](/cypherpunk-transmission-004-gpg-encrypted-communication/)).*

**-3RA**
