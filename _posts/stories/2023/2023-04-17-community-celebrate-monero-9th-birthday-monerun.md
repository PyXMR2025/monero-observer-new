The Monero community is getting ready to celebrate its second *Monerun*[^1] event tomorrow, on the project's 9th birthday:

> **Monerun will take place on 18th of April.** Let this be a moment for all crypto projects to join forces and create awareness for the importance of self-custody and celebrate self-sovereignity. (gr8ful4)[^2]

The Monerun tradition was born last year and it ended up confirming widespread suspicions that *most exchanges are fractionally reserved on XMR*. 

Read bawdyanarchist's 2022 postmortem *The Monerun - After Action Report*[^3] and *FAQ*[^4] post for more information.

Note that if you don't have XMR on any CEX, you can still take part in the community action by buying a small amount and then withdrawing to a self-custodial wallet that you fully control.

**Let us proceed together apace.**[^5]

*Special street cred goes to gnuteardrops from monero.graphics[^6] for the cool banner design.*

**Update: MoneroFox shared a Monerun 2023 report with results for public audit of XMR reserves[^7].**
