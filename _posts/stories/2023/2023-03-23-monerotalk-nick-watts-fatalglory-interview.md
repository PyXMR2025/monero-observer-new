> [..] doing things that are moral but illegal in order to undermine the authority of the state; once you get your head around that then private untraceable digital cash is just an obvious means to that end. (Nick @ 46:45)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including the current state of XMR adoption in Australia, religion and digital cash, the issues with taxation and the fiat system, property rights and agorism.
