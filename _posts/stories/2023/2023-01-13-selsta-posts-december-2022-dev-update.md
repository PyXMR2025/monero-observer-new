selsta[^1] has posted a monthly CCS progress report[^2] for December 2022, which includes the following dev updates:

```
Milestone 2:
- Since there are quite a lot of changes since the last release I decided to delay the release prepare v0.18.2.0 instead of v0.18.1.3 with Dandelion++ changes, network stability changes, RandomX refactor, RingCT cache, P2Pool hard-fork support.
- Fix a bug that causes our tests workflow to fail in some cases.
- Smaller fixes, improvements and maintenance work (CLI, GUI)
```

Note that *misc* work is not explicitly mentioned in these updates. The full list of changes can be found on Github[^3]'[^4].

This update completes the second milestone of selsta's part-time (Nov-Jan) Monero development CCS proposal[^5].
