AnarkioCrypto[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for adding an opt-in *skip sync*[^3] feature to Monero wallets:

> A "skip sync" feature would allow users to save time and mobile data, if they know they haven't received Monero since the last time they opened their wallet.

```
Total Bounty: 0 XMR (to date)
```

Anyone can increase the bounty by transferring any XMR amount to the address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty’s thread[^2].

Consult the *monero-skip-sync.md*[^3] document to learn more about AnarkioCrypto's idea. 

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
