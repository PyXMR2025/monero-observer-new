CryptoGrampy[^1] has posted a CCS update[^2], announcing the completion of his *HotShop*[^3] project, an *ephemeral* browser-based Monero point of sale:

> The HotShop CCS is complete. It's been deployed and usable on the free static site host, Render.com for a number of months now- people are using it, I have yet to have a person reach out with a bug (besides my node being down) and it's had over a dozen unique clones in just the past week alone. [..] Thank you all for your support.

### CCS accomplishments overview

- HotShop works: a very simple to use payment validator that requires zero downloads or hosting
- It runs over Tor
- It can be deployed via a static hosting provider or self-hosted with the regularly updated Docker image
- It can be set up in under 2 minutes
- All of the Coingecko Fiat pairs are supported
- HotShop can be used as a progressive web app

CryptoGrampy plans to continue hosting a web-compatible HotShop node[^4] for the next several months and will also support the project with updates.

To learn more about HotShop, consult the previous Monero Observer report[^5].

To support CryptoGrampy's work, consider contributing to his *Laptop Fund*[^6].
