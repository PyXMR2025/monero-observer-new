In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] discusses the *Bitcoin Fog* tumbler case[^4] with federal trial attorneys Tor Ekeland[^5] and Mike Hassard[^6]:

> [..] our client stands accused of running a Bitcoin tumbler called 'Bitcoin Fog' for 10 years and laundering 336 million dollars worth of drug money crypto, except there's not a single piece of evidence that he ever operated 'Bitcoin Fog' .. (Tor @ 4:11)

Several related topics are also discussed in this interview, including Monero vs BTC, Tornado Cash, blockchain analysis, and some advice for the Monero community.
