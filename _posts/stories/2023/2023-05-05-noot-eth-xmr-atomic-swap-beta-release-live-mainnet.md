noot[^1] has announced[^2] that the ETH-XMR atomic swap beta release (v0.2.1)[^3], was deployed on mainnet and is now *live and ready to be used*:

> Hey all! I'm happy to announce that the ETH-XMR atomic swap beta release, which has been deployed on mainnet, is live and ready to be used! [..] Huge thank you to the community for your support, and I hope you enjoy using the swap :)

This release is CLI-only and the program has been tested primarily on Linux only. 

XMR-holders provide liquidity as market makers, and ETH-holders are the takers. Relayers help secure the network and get 0.01 ETH of the swap value in return for relaying.

Usage instructions and pre-built binaries are available on Github[^4]. Join the project's Matrix room[^5] for technical support and project discussions.

The development of this ETH-XMR atomic swap implementation was funded via the CCS[^6] and the Magic Monero Fund[^7].

*Note that although the software was 'thoroughly tested', there are always potential failure cases. Use at your own risk.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
