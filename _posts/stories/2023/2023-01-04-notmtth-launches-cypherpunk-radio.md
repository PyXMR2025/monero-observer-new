NotMtth[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of *CypherPunk Radio*[^3]'[^4], *an independent internet radio focused on being private, secure & unstoppable*:

> [..] I got the concept radio up and running (cypherpunkradio.com, mirrors on this site). [..] Hope to see some feedback soon, more updates in the following days will come.

Listeners can add songs[^5] to the queue and stream directly from the browser via the non-clearnet mirrors (Tor/I2P)[^6]. Instructions for Mplayer, VLC, and Android users are available on the website[^7].

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^8] to learn more about the associated CCS proposal[^9].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: CCS proposal closed[^10].**
