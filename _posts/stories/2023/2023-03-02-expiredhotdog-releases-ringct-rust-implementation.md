expiredhotdog[^1] has announced[^2] the release of a *fast, stable, pure-Rust implementation of Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) using Ristretto*[^3]:

> I initially made this just for "fun" (I'm a nerd), but decided to release it because why not. This implementation is mostly optimized for speed and being relatively easy to use, and currently is not very flexible or feature-rich.

Consult the Github repository[^3] for usage instructions, benchmarks, and a tentative roadmap. 

*Note that this implementation has not been formally audited. Use at your own risk.*
