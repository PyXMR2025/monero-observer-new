In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews Monero dev Jethro Grassie (jtgrassie)[^4]:

> [..] there's nothing we can do to stop steganography [..] we can make it harder, sure. The real solution is a full membership proof [..] there's people working on Seraphis to increase our ring size [..] but if 90% of that ring is sticking these transactions from Mordinals, then there's still not much use, is there? (jtgrassie @ 44:40)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including Monero ordinals and *tx_extra*, the importance of transaction uniformity, and steganography.
