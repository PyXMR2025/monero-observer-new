Cake Labs[^1] has announced[^2] the first *Cake Wallet*[^3] beta release[^4] for Linux, which has a *rough feature parity* with the MacOS desktop version:

> Over the years, we have built a user-friendly wallet, and we are happy to bring our open-source, non-custodial Flutter app to Linux for the first time!

### Features overview

```
Send and receive Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Haven
Works on popular operating systems, including Tails, Ubuntu, and others
Full Monero subaddress and account support
Restore mobile backups on desktop, and vice versa
Optionally select a manual remote node
[..]
```

New versions for the Cake Wallet (v4.6.5) and Monero.com[^5] (v1.3.6) mobile wallets were also released today with several bug fixes and one UI improvement.

Consult the Github repository[^4] to verify and download the wallet .flatpak and .apk's.

*Note that the Linux version is considered beta until Cake gets 'more testing feedback'.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
