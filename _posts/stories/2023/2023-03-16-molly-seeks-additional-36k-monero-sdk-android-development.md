valldrac[^1], the lead developer of Android Signal fork Molly.im[^2], has announced in a recent CCS update[^3] that the project is currently looking for *an additional 36,000 USD to cover the development time of the SDK*[^4]:

> Over the past six months, our team has invested more than 550 hours into researching and developing the SDK. We made a mistake in our original proposal by underestimating the amount of work required to add a Monero library to Molly in less than 100 hours. [..] we are kindly requesting your support in bridging the funding gap that has emerged due to the extra work required for the SDK development.

Read the full progress report on Gitlab[^3] and consult previous Monero Observer stories[^5]'[^6] to learn more about this project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/3/17: add link to SDK repository[^4].**

**Update 23/5/17: CCS proposal submitted[^7].**
