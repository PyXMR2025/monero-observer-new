> [on Monero governance] [..] so what you need is a process of decision making that's outside of the actual Github [..] else it's just far too vulnerable for someone to come along and start [..] bribing, you know, with a lot of money, some of the developers .. (Justin @ 38:51)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including PoW, the separation of money and state, digital cash vs store of value, Monero critiques, and why Bitcoin is destined to fail.
