In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews privacy advocate Sethforprivacy[^4]:

> [..] obviously we are choosing to focus on Bitcoin-first, because I think this is something that I'm kind of coming to grips with a little bit too, and that network effect that is behind Bitcoin is important [..] but I think there's definitely an appreciation for Monero, broadly across the team. (Seth @ 11:55)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including Seth's new job at *Foundation*[^5], strengths and weaknesses of XMR & Zcash, Monero hardware wallets, and zk-SNARKs[^6].
