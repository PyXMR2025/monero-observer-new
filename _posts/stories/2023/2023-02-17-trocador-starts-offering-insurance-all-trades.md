The Trocador.app[^1] exchange aggregator has started offering *insurance on all trades*[^2] via *Trocador Guarantee*, as promised last week[^3]:

> If for some reason you do not receive your funds and the exchange does not provide us some proof of a legal order to explain why the swap was not completed, Trocador will reimburse you up to the amount shown for each exchange![^4]

The insured amount is currently *around $550* but there are plans to increase that amount *as time goes by*.

To get compensation, users need to contact Trocador and provide their *Transaction ID*. Note that the whole process can take a week.

To learn more about Trocador, consult the previous Monero Observer reports[^5]'[^6].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
