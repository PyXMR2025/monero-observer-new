CypherStack[^1] has completed a partial code audit of Serai DEX[^2] and reported no *findings of particular immediate concern*[^3]:

> This was our biggest audit yet! It was a pleasure to work with you all at Serai, and we're thrilled to be a part in making the dream of good DEXs a reality. (cypher_stack)[^4]
 
> This notably includes our IETF (draft) compliant #FROST library, which we've applied to $BTC, $ETH, and $XMR! (SeraiDEX)[^5]

The full report is available on Github[^6].

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7] and join *#serai* on Matrix[^8] to learn more and get involved with the project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
