Dr. Mitchell Krawiec-Thayer (Isthmus[^1]) has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to do *computational work for OSPEAD[^3] parameterization*:

> To achieve the best fit for OSPEAD parametrization, the analysis code developed by Rucknium needs to be computed over a much larger portion of recent Monero transactions.  [..] This proposal is designed to solve the challenge posed by the computational barriers [..] The overall project to speed up OSPEAD computation will take 5+ full time engineering weeks [..]

```
Total funding: 190 XMR (upfront).

ETA: 5.5 weeks (March 30 2023).
```

### Milestones overview

- M1: Begin development (190 XMR)
- M2: Deliver code, results, and documentation to Rucknium (0 XMR)

Isthmus is an MRL contributor and the *President* and *Chief Scientist* of *Geometry Labs*[^4]. Read his analysis reports[^5]'[^6]'[^7]'[^8] to learn more about the researcher's past Monero work.

More information about Rucknium's OSPEAD (*Optimal Static Parametric Estimation of Arbitrary Distributions*) is available on Monero Observer[^9]'[^10].

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !375[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: proposal temporarily closed[^11].**
