plowsof[^1] has submitted a third (and final) progress report[^2] after working for more than three months as CCS coordinator[^3]:

> I hope the people who have supported me are satisfied with my performance. I am not perfect, and make mistakes - hopefully i have shown that i am able to change / move forward when this happens. 1 or 2 legal threats, but it seems like i've made it out onto the other side relatively unscathed knocks on hollow head. Thank you for reading.

### Work summary

- [CCS] helped 4 proposals move to funding (FeatherWallet, Independent Monero Film, Monero Observer, AcceptXMR)
- [CCS] focused on 3 'problem' proposals (MollyIM - not abandoned, SoloptXMR - no 'comparable update', Animated Videos - on-going issue)
- [Testing/Misc] testing of a PR uncovered long wait time to generate addresses[^4]; monero gui's windows installer creator now allows people to build as soon as gitian binaries are available[^5]; reverted a small feature in time for release (#4124)[^6]; noticed that the ccs wallet is 242 xmr over funded[^7] [..]

The full progress report is available on Gitlab[^2].

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^8] to learn more about plowsof's CCS proposal.
