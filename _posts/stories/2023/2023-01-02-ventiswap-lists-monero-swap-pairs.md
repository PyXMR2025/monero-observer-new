VentiSwap[^1] DEX has just listed[^2] two Monero swap pairs: XMR/USDT and XMR/ETH.

> Just listed on VentiSwap @monero (XMR)! XMR is currently able to be traded with ETH and USDT with further pairings to come!

*Note: the service is not Tor-friendly and the platform uses a proprietary algorithm for the cross-chain swaps. Consider using Atomic Swaps/other DEX/P2P exchanges instead, if possible.*

**Update: Binance is apparently providing all the liquidity on VentiSwap[^3] (thanks to MoneroFox for pointing that out).**
