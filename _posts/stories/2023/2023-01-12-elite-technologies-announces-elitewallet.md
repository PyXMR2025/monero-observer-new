EliteTechnologies[^1] has announced[^2] *Elite Wallet*[^3] (v1.0.1[^4]), a new *privacy oriented* open source *multi-currency mobile wallet* that supports XMR, WOW, BTC, and LTC:

> The goal of EliteWallet is to provide a mobile wallet [..] that is simple and easy to use while preserving the highest level of user privacy.

### Features overview

- Completely noncustodial
- Support for socks5 proxies
- Built-in exchange for dozens of pairs
- Buy cryptocurrency with credit/debit/bank
- Sell cryptocurrency by bank transfer
- The Monero view key is retained on the device for maximum privacy
- Full support for Monero subaddresses and accounts
- Specify restore height for faster syncing
- Specify multiple recipients for batch sending
- [..]

Consult the wallet's code repository[^5] for the complete list of features and build instructions.

EliteWallet is currently only available for download from the Play Store[^6] and as an .APK[^7], but an App Store version and a desktop version will be released *soon*.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: there appears to be some controversy surrounding the project - commit history removal (after forking Cake's codebase)[^8]; Coingecko pings[^9].**
