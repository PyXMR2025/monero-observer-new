VostoEmisio[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to create a short *ELI5-style* animated video explaining Monero's Tail Emission[^3]:

> I propose that we create an animation series featuring short (1 min or so), ELI5-style explainer videos that break down the key concepts of how Monero works [..] I would like to start with (as our name vosto emisio also springs from), the tail emission concept. 

```
Total funding proposed: 9 XMR.

ETA: ~1 month.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Complete Script (3 XMR)
- M2: Complete "Look and feel" (3 XMR)
- M3: Complete Video (3 XMR)

VostoEmisio recently won the MoneroKon 23 Design Proposal[^4] and also *revamped* the logo and branding for *bchmempool.cash* and *beta.redteam.cash*.

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !387[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
