*ARIS.io*[^1] has announced[^2] a new *Monero-first* platform where users can buy, sell and exchange cryptocurrencies: 

> Our goal is to connect the Monero community to the fiat currency world, in a compliant way, with an EU-licensed platform. Our secure platform provides you with XMR-EUR on/off ramp, easy swaps from XMR to BTC/USDT and offers you top-tier support. Our future plans include concierge services such as an OTC trading desk.

It is worth mentioning that Monero Core Team member and *XMR.to*[^3] founder, binaryFate[^4] is *one of the investors*[^5] in the Bulgarian company.

Note that ARIS enforces what they call *respectful KYC*: users are required to complete SMS verification for crypto-to-crypto transactions, and provide selfies, photos of ID documents, and full names for fiat transactions[^6].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
