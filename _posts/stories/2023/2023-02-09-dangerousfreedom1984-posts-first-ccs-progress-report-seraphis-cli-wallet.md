DangerousFreedom1984[^1] has submitted the first progress report[^2] for their CCS[^3] proposal to help develop a simple Seraphis CLI wallet and audit framework:

> I would like to give a report about this CCS but first I would like to thank koe, rbrunner, jberman, rucknium and everyone participating in the wallet efforts.

### Progress overview

- **New knowledge_proofs**: enote_ownership_proof, enote_amount_proof, enote_sent_proof, address_ownership_proof, address_index_proof, enote_key_image_proof, tx_funded_proof, enote_unspent_proof, reserve_proof (pdf[^4])
- **Wallet work**: I would say that this[^5] code ends this proposed task and it opens many questions for the next tasks that I would like to investigate [..]

Read the full progress report on Gitlab[^2].
