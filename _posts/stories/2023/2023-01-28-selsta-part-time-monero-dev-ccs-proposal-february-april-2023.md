selsta[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of April 2023:

> Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months (from Februrary to end of April) at a rate of 45€ / hour. At 159€ / XMR (14-day EMA) this makes 102 XMR.

```
Total funding: 102 XMR.

ETA: (end of) April 2023.
```

He plans to focus on *major release v0.18.2.0 (P2Pool hard-fork[^3] support, Dandelion++ fixes, RandomX refactor, RingCT cache, network stability improvements)*, testing and reviewing PR's, Monero release engineering and other smaller dev work on the CLI and GUI.

selsta has contributed over 615 merged commits to both the CLI[^4] and GUI[^5] codebases since 2018.
