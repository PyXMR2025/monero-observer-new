In response to a recent Monero Observer inquiry, LocalMonero[^1] has confirmed that Russia was removed from their trading platform on February 1st 2023.

Although unable to comment on the reasons behind the decision, they seemed open to the possibility of reversing it *soon*:

> Hopefully, we can re-enable it soon.

The Monero community is currently discussing this issue on Reddit[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
