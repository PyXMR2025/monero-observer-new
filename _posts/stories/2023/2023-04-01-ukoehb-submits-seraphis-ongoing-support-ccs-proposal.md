UkoeHB[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] for Seraphis *ongoing support*, with a primary focus on updating the Seraphis paper draft[^3]:

> In the previous CCS I refined the seraphis library to a satisfying state. It can now be considered in 'final draft' form. [..] There are additional tasks I would like to work on. [..] I will split the current draft into two papers, one focused on the core Seraphis abstraction and the other focused on the current implementation using Jamtis.

```
Total funding: 163.70 XMR (60 USD + 0.4 XMR rate).

ETA: TBD (240hrs total).
```

### Tasks overview

- update the Seraphis paper draft
- support the Seraphis migration workgroup
- build a demo for a secure and efficient escrowed market using Monero 2-of-3 multisig with the Seraphis library
- participate in ongoing Monero R&D discussions and tasks

To learn more about UkoeHB's work, consult the most recent dev update[^4], the *Preliminary Seraphis Design Overview*[^5] document, and the previous Monero Observer report[^6].

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !384[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: proposal moved to funding stage[^7].**
