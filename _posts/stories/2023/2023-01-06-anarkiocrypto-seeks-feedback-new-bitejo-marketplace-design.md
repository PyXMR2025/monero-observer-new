AnarkioCrypto[^1] is looking[^2] for feedback on the new Bitejo[^3]'[^4] crypto marketplace design:

> Redesigned Bitejo (Monero marketplace for products/services) Looking for feedback 

Users can buy and sell *products, jobs and exchanges* for BTC, XMR, gold, silver and cash. Bitejo has zero listing fees and there is no KYC.

AnarkioCrypto was recently looking for a team to *take over* the platform, as previously reported[^5].

*Note that Bitejo is currently in beta testing and high value transactions are not advised.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
