AnarkioCrypto[^1] has launched the beta version of his Monero-based *Kuno Fundraisers*[^2] platform, a *KYC-free, crypto-friendly and non-custodial alternative to Gofundme/Kickstarter/Patreon*, and open sourced its code[^3]:

> Kuno Fundraisers beta is live now [..] Here is the code [..] I apologize that it's messy, amateur-level and not fully tested. Hopefully some of it may be useful.[^4]

The dev also plans to release the source code for the *Bitejo*[^5] marketplace, *hopefully tomorrow*.

Users can browse existing fundraisers and start their own for free, on *kuno.bitejo.com*[^2].

To learn more about Anarkio's work and vision, visit his blog[^6].

*Note that the code is 'amateur-level, messy and not fully tested'. Inspect before using.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/3/24: plowsof provided an alternative URL redirect by pointing p2pcrowd.fund[^7] to kuno.bitejo.com.**

**Update 23/3/25: Bitejo source code released, as promised[^8].**
