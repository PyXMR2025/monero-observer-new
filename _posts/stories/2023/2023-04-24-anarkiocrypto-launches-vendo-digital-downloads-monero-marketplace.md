AnarkioCrypto[^1] has launched *Vendo Digital Downloads*[^2], an experimental Monero marketplace for buying and selling digital products, without fees or KYC:

> It is mainly a proof-of-concept for digital downloads, which uses TXID + TX key for non-custodial payment processing (sellers receive funds directly to their wallet) and uses auto-fulfillment so that buyers receive their download link, code or file immediately after payment is confirmed (sellers don't need to process orders manually).[^3]

Both Vendo and Kuno Fundraisers[^4] are based on *old code* from AnarkioCrypto's Bitejo[^5] marketplace.

Vendo is open source and installation instructions are available on Codeberg[^6].

To learn more about Anarkio's work and vision, visit his blog[^7].

*Note that Vendo is not production-ready and it should be treated as 'an experimental work in progress'.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
