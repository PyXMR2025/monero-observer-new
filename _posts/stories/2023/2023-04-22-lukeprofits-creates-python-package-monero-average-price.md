lukeprofits[^1] has created *monero-usd-price*[^2], a Python package[^3] that pulls in the *current XMR/USD exchange rate from 10+ different exchanges* and gets the *median price*[^4]:

> Monero-USD-Price is an easy way to get the current median or average price of Monero in USD. Median is recommended over average, because it is less sensitive to outliers.

The script requires Python 3.8+[^5] and the *Requests*[^6] HTTP library. Consult the README.md[^7] file for a list of supported exchanges, installation and usage instructions.

The Python dev is currently working on a *functional proof of concept* for *decentralized recurring subscriptions with Monero*[^8].

If you appreciate lukeprofits's work, transfer some XMR to their donation address[^9].

*Note: if possible, inspect the code before executing any scripts on your machines.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
