NotMtth[^1] has decided to close[^2] the CCS funding proposal[^3] for the *CypherPunk Radio*[^4] project, after it failed to gather enough support during the past few *-community* meetings[^5]'[^6]:

> The Monero community decided to close our CCS proposal so we added a donation address on our website. [..] Thanks to everyone :)

To support the project, transfer XMR to the address listed on the official website[^7].
