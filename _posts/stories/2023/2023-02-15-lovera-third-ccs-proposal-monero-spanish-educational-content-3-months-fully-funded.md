Lovera[^1]'s third CCS proposal[^2] to continue producing educational content for the Spanish-speaking community for 3 months is now fully funded:

```
24 contributors raised ~12 XMR (114%+)
```

To learn more about Lovera’s work, consult my previous report[^3].

*Note: the proposal was moved directly to the WIP stage at plowsof's request, as the funding page was not updating correctly[^4], despite reaching its donation goal[^5].*
