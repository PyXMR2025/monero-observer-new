Ora_pro_vivis[^1] is looking for feedback[^2] on *Lumo*[^3], an experimental PoC *semi transparent and auditable* XMR wallet app:

> Lumo (loo-mo), Esperanto for "Light", is a Node JS server that allows you to self host a semi transparent and auditable Monero (XMR) wallet for donation and charity purposes. [..] If you do decide to test the code, please be sure to let me know of any bugs. I'd also love to hear thoughts, opinions, feedback, and security/vulnerability concerns with hosting something like this on mainnet.

Installation instructions are available on *git.rezisto.net*[^4].

To support the project, donate XMR to the address listed in the official code repository[^5].

Ora_pro_vivis has also announced that the alpha version of the *Kasejo*[^6] (*Merchant*) POS desktop app will be *pushed back a little further into this year*. Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7] to learn more about that project.

*Note that 'Lumo' should be considered experimental software. Only use it on stagenet.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
