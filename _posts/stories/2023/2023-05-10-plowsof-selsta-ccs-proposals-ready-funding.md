Two CCS proposals have been moved to the funding stage and are now looking for community support: 

- plowsof's !385[^1]: CCS Coordinator work for 3 months[^2]
- selsta's !386[^3]: part-time Monero development work for 3 months[^4]

To support the above proposals you can donate to the XMR addresses listed on the *Funding Required*[^5] page.

**Update: both proposals were fully funded[^6].**
