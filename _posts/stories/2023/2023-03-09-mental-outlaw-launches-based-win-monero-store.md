Mental Outlaw[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of *Based.win*[^3], a new online apparel and electronics store that accepts XMR payments:

> [..] how am I gonna set up a store and not accept Monero? How is anybody going to have a business and not accept Monero? That's like opening a business in America and saying that you're not going to accept US Dollars. That's crazy. (1:30)

The website is probably using *monerowp*[^4], the Monero WooCommerce plugin for Wordpress.

Mental Outlaw currently has ~437K subscribers on YouTube.
