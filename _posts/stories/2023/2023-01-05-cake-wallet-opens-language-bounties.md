Cake Wallet[^1] has opened 11 new language bounties[^2] worth $150 each:

> Help us add Arabic, Bengali, Urdu, Indonesian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Amharic, and Burmese to Cake Wallet![^3]

Bounties are paid in XMR after the pull request is merged. Instructions for adding new languages can be found on Github[^4].

Note that in order to complete more than 1 translation, you are required to sign a consulting agreement with Cake and provide your name.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
