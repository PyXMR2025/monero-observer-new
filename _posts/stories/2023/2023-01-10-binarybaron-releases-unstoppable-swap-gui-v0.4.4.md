binarybaron[^1] has released version 0.4.4[^2] of *UnstoppableSwap*[^3], the XMR<>BTC atomic swaps GUI:

### Changes overview

```
Add notice that user does not need to deposit funds beforehand
Fix issue where AppImage would not start due to bundling issue of sqlite3
Require MIN_ASB_VERSION of 0.12.0 [..]
```

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4] to learn more about the associated CCS proposal[^5].

To support the development of UnstoppableSwap, you can transfer XMR to the project's donation address[^6].

*Note that this project is still in beta, and as always with experimental software, there is some risk (including loss of funds). Use at your own risk.*

**Update: v0.4.5 was released[^7].**
