In this Monero Magazine[^1] episode[^2], host Michael Fitzgerald[^3] interviews Sethforprivacy[^4]:

> [..] so when we look at Bitcoin as well as Monero, if it's working properly to give us power over the state, rather than giving the state power over us, governments are going to want to stop it .. (Seth @ 12:00)

Several topics are covered in this short interview, including Monero FUD, auditing Monero's supply, BTC privacy, decentralization and security.

Monero Magazine previously interviewed Seth in December 2022[^5].
