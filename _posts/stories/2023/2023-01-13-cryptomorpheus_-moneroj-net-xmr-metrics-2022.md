CryptoMorpheus_[^1] has published a new Moneroj.net[^2] XMR metrics article[^3] in which he interprets past year performance and what that could indicate for 2023:

> It's been a few months since Moneroj last released an article, as our developers were busy delivering our privacy-focused exchange aggregator Trocador.app. But now it's time to analyze what to expect for 2023. In order to preview this year's behavior, let's look how was last year's action.

The report references several charts, including Binance withdrawals[^4], Golden Ratio Multiplier[^5], Thermocap Multiple[^6], Sharpe Ratio[^7], and Monero's Marketcap Dominance[^8].

To support CryptoMorpheus_'s work and keep the Moneroj.net project free for everyone, donate XMR to the address listed on the About[^9] page.
