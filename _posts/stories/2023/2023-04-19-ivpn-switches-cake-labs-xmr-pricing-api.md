IVPN[^1] has announced[^2] that they recently switched to using Cake Labs[^3]'s XMR/USD pricing API[^4] for generating customer invoices:

> We have recently changed our XMR pricing API aiming for better stability, ideally provided by a trustworthy actor in the Monero space. @cakewallet fit the bill perfectly.

The well-respected VPN provider also stressed that *no customer or purchase related information is passed on to Cake Labs*[^5].

The *custom-built* API is currently used in Cake Wallet[^6] and Monero.com[^7]. Consult the documentation[^4] provided by Cake Labs for information about features, pricing plans, and privacy practices. 

To learn more about IVPN, watch Monero Talk's interview[^8] with Viktor Vecsei.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
