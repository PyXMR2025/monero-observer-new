defeatoverseer[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for conducting research on countermeasures for the *Overseer Attack*[^3]:

> Need a quantifiable counter measure for preventing the Overseer Attack. Will be paying for this research.[^4]

```
Total Bounty: 1.5 XMR (to date)
```

To increase the bounty you can contribute some XMR to the address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty’s thread[^2].

This topic is currently being discussed in *#monero-research-lab*[^5].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: bounty increased from ~1.1 to 1.5 XMR.**
