lukeprofits[^1] is planning[^2] to release the alpha version of *Monero Subscriptions Wallet*[^3], a feeless decentralized *Monero-Based Patreon-like* desktop app, on May 19th:

> The Monero Subscriptions Wallet will provide a way for people to automatically pay recurring subscriptions in Monero (whether it is a recurring subscription for your VPN, anything else, or a Patreon-like donation to your favorite content creator or developer).

### Project overview

```
Automatically pay recurring subscriptions with Monero
No need for users to remember to pay monthly invoices
Desktop app (wallet) for users
Written in Python (using Monero Wallet RPC) [..]
```

Join *#MoneroRecurringSubscriptions*[^4] on Matrix to learn more about the project.

lukeprofits has also created the *monero-usd-price* Python package last month, as reported[^5].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
