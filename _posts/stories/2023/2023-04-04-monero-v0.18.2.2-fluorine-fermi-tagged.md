The official Monero v0.18.2.2 *Fluorine Fermi* has been tagged (CLI[^1]/GUI[^2]) and the release binaries should be out soon. 

### Release highlights

```
CLI:
- Daemon: add a size limit for `tx_extra` in tx pool
- Daemon: avoid log entries when re-blocking a subnet
- Daemon: fix deadlock and crash when syncing with full dataset on Window
- Daemon: don't drop peers for soft offenses
- Wallet: fix infinite loop in fake out selection
- Wallet: add Ledger Stax support
GUI:
- Add support for Ledger Stax
- Update p2pool to v3.2
- Minor bug fixes and UI improvements
```

Note that this point release will add a size limit for *tx_extra* in the transaction pool. The previous version (0.18.2.1) was delayed due to a few bugs that needed patching[^3].

Contributors are encouraged to share the results of their deterministic build processes[^4] by making a pull request to the *monero-project/gitian.sigs*[^5] repository.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: v0.18.2.2 released[^6].**
