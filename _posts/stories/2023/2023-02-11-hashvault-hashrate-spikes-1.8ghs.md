The top XMR mining pool, HashVault.pro[^1], experienced a sharp hashrate spike from ~650 MH/s to around 1.8 GH/s earlier today.

The ~1 GH/s *pool miner*[^2] that is apparently responsible for the surge could potentially suggest *botnet activity*.

Although HashVault's HR has recently dropped back to ~1.2 GH/s, the pool still controls almost ~35% of the total Monero network hashrate of ~3.4 GH/s.

At least two other similar spikes were registered in October[^3] and December 2022[^4].

It is interesting to note that P2Pool's HR is down ~33.3% for the day.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/2/12: the pool miner's account was spotted on nanopool.org today[^5]'[^6].**

**Update 23/2/13: HR back to 'normal' levels ~650 MH/s.**

**Update 23/2/27: the same pool miner appears to be back on HV[^7].**
