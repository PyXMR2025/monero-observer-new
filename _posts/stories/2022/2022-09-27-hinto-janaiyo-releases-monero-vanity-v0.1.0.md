hinto-janaiyo[^1] has released version 0.1.0[^2] of *monero-vanity*[^3], a CPU-only (x86, 64-bit) CLI tool that generates XMR vanity addresses and spend keys:

```
Example:
44hintoFpuo3ugKfcqJvh5BmrsTRpnTasJmetKC4 [..]
```

The open source software was written in Rust and it is a faster alternative to vanity-monero[^4], which was written in Go.

Consult the README.md[^5] file in the project's code repository for usage and build instructions.

The sources, binaries, SHA256SUM and .asc files can be found on the Github release page[^2]. Always verify before using.

hinto-janaiyo is also working on version 2 of *monero-bash* and the associated CCS proposal[^6] is currently looking for feedback.

*Note that monero-vanity is still a work in progress. Use at your own risk.*
