Panda[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to create 10 different Monero paper wallet designs:

> [..] I thought of producing 10 different new designs, each one in 2 different formats: A4 for a classic foldable paper wallet, Credit card dimensions for a different way of keeping your seed safe

```
Total funding: 13.33 XMR.

ETA: ~80 hours.
```

### Milestones

The payment will be equally split among 10 milestones, one for each design (1.33 XMR x 10).
