Rucknium[^1] has completed[^2] the first milestone for their *Optimal Static Parametric Estimation of Arbitrary Distributions* (OSPEAD)[^3] CCS proposal[^4]:

> The OSPEAD fully specified estimation plan has been transmitted to the scientific review panel, which consists of ArticMine, isthmus, and hyc.

Read the full PGP signed message on Gitlab[^2].

The document is *about 80 pages* and a public version *with about half of the content removed*[^5] will be released next week.

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^6] to learn more about the project.

**Update: Isthmus has confirmed the document transfer[^7].**
