fatalglory[^1] has published the code for his *monero-tx-scanner*[^2] npm package[^3] on Github. 

The tool can be used for scanning incoming Monero transactions and it should be helpful for people working on POS apps:

> I've published the code for an NPM package that allows fully client-side scanning of XMR transactions.[^4]

To learn more about features, usage examples and inspect the code, consult the Github repository[^2]. 

To support the project, donate XMR to the address listed in the *Tips*[^5] section of the *README.md* file.

The dev has also recently created *monerod-proxy*[^6], a small Golang app that enables more merchants to start accepting XMR for payments.
