Apparently, some readers are irritated by the way I *activate* only the immediately relevant external footnote links for each report.

This was a deliberate day 1 decision that (IMHO) has a few benefits:

- major visual impact (quickly distinguish the news source vs older/parallel references)
- minor security/privacy bonus (decreased misclick chance)

Although innately hesitant to change things, I am always open to feedback and suggestions. 

Are you in favor of making all links clickable? Contact me and let me know. 

Do you support the status quo? Again, I would appreciate a short message.

Thanks for participating. Enjoy family time!
