In this Monero Magazine[^1] episode[^2], host Michael Fitzgerald[^3] interviews crypto enthusiast Vanessa Harris[^4]:

> I think the best way to speed up [Monero] adoption is to have some very prominent people targeted because of their Bitcoin transactions, because that will allow the story to really be told. (Vanessa @ 15:46)

Several topics are covered in this interview, including: CBDC's and social credit scores, DeFi, Monero's role in society, regulation and adoption.

Vanessa was also interviewed by Monero Talk earlier this year[^5]. To learn more about the guest, visit her website[^6].
