noot[^1] has completed[^2] the 5th milestone for her XMR-ETH atomic swaps CCS proposal[^3]:

> Hey again, happy to announce that milestone 5 and the final core development focused milestone for this CCS is done! [..]

### Work overview

- created 9 swap instances in the cloud running on Monero stagenet and Ethereum's Goerli testnet
- created an automated tester to make and take offers
- relevant PRs: #108[^4], #111[^5], #117[^6]

Read the full dev report[^2] and consult *stagenet.md*[^7] to learn how you can join the network and try out the swap as a XMR-taker or XMR-maker.

noot plans[^8] on prioritizing the last 2 CCS milestones next:

> milestone 6 is regarding further research and a write-up of the protocol [..] just need to finalize and organize the document.

> milestone 7 is regarding the UI. The last task to be done here is Metamask integration.

Consult my previous report[^9] to learn more about the project.
