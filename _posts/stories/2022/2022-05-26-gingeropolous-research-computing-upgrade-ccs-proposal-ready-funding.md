Gingeropolous[^1]'s *Research Computing Upgrade* CCS proposal[^2] to provide high-end server infrastructure access to the Monero research and development community is now ready for funding[^3]:

```
15 contributors raised 51 of 51 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^3] page.
