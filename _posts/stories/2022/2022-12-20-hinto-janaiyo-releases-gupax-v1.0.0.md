hinto-janaiyo[^1] has released *Gupax*[^2] version 1.0.0[^3] just before *Christmas time*, as promised[^4]:

> After a few optimizations/fixes and 3 days of uptime on all OS's, it seemed like Gupax was ready, so: Gupax v1.0.0 released.[^5]

This update completes the first milestone of the associated CCS proposal[^6] and the project is now in *maintenance mode*.

The sources, SHA256SUM and .asc files can be found on Github[^3] and on the new *gupax.io* website[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
