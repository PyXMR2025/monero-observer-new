mister-rrr[^1] has launched a new XMR merchant directory website (*xmr.directory*[^2]):

> I've developed a website where you just type the name of the product you want to buy, and it shows you a list of merchants where you can pay for it with Monero. I am looking for feedback on the site's design, functionality and user friendliness.[^3]

### Features

- merchant reviews
- propose the addition of new merchants
- search engine

The website can also be accessed via Tor, although the onionsite[^4] is currently down.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
