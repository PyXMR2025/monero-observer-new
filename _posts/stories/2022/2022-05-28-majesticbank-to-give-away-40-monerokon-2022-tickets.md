MajesticBank[^1] is looking to give away[^2] 40 tickets to the sold out[^3] MoneroKon 2022[^4] event for free, sponsor flights for 10 and accommodation for 5 applicants:

> You love, support Monero and wanted to be present on MoneroKon 2022 but tickets are sold out? MajesticBank got your back as always. We are giving away 40 tickets to MoneroKon 2022 for FREE.

> Best application and most relevant to Monero are eligible for extra benefits as we will sponsor flights tickets in both ways for 10 of you and accommodation for 5 of you.

According to the announcement, applications can be sent via email[^5], support ticket[^6] or Reddit PM[^7] and should include *reasons why you wanted so much to be present on MoneroKon 2022* and, optionally, *links to online presence profiles in Monero community*.

MajesticBank is currently sponsoring Haveno[^8], as previously reported[^9].

More tickets to the conference might also be offered to people on the MoneroKon22 official waiting list[^10].
