The OrangeFren[^1] project has announced[^2] the addition of a new *Guarantee* service, which aims to protect its users from misbehaving exchanges: 

> The OrangeFren Guarantee is a service that works like a security deposit which is paid for by the exchanges I partner up with [..] if your money were ever to be stolen by the exchange you'll be able to get it back directly from me.

Note that *OrangeFren Guarantee* currently only applies to *FixedFloat*[^3] trades.

Compensation amounts, limits and conditions are listed on the website and in the announcement thread[^2].

To learn more about the project, consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4].
