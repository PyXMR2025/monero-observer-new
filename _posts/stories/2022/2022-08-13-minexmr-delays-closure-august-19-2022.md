MineXMR[^1] has decided to change the pool's closure date from August 12[^2] to August 19 *to give more time for miners to switch pools*:

> Please reconfigure your miners to use a different pool before this date. Any miners that are not updated before August 19 will stop working. We recommend transitioning to the decentralised p2pool.

The Monero community is currently discussing[^3] this announcement on IRC/Matrix in the *-community*[^4] room.

MineXMR is still in the top 5 Monero pools[^5], but its hashrate has dropped to ~160 MH/s. P2Pool is #6 with ~150 MH/s.

Consult previous reports[^6]'[^7]'[^8] for demos and guides, if you need help getting started with P2Pool[^9].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: the pool is now closed (0 miners/hashrate).**
