Elizabeth (noot[^1]) has submitted a second CCS proposal[^2] to continue developing ETH-XMR atomic swaps for 4 months:

> I would like to continue work on the ETH-XMR atomic swap implementation by adding improvements for usability and privacy, as well as general codebase maintainence.

```
Total funding: 162 XMR.

ETA: 4 months (TBD).
```

### Proposed work

- Relayer support
- Tornado cash integration
- ERC20 support
- Disk permanence
- General maintainence and bugfixes

With her previous CCS proposal[^3], she has already completed an implementation of the ETH-XMR atomic swap[^4], deployed it to stagenet on 9 different servers and extensively tested it. An alpha release[^5] is available on Github.

noot has also *begun to approach others regarding integrating the swap into a GUI/wallet*, according to the associated discussion thread[^6].

To learn more about Elizabeth's work, consult previous Monero Observer reports[^7]'[^8]'[^9].

**Update 22/7/30: proposal closed by noot, who is *planning to go with a MAGIC Monero Fund grant instead*[^10].**
