shermand100[^1] is currently looking[^2] for assistance from web developers, network specialists, and other technical users that can contribute to Monero ecosystem project PiNodeXMR[^3]:

> Maybe there are are skills you have that can assist Monero growth but directly contributing to the Monero codebase is a bit daunting at the moment. [..] There are a few things specifically I could use a bit of assistance with, but generally input on anything is appreciated.

PiNodeXMR aims to *make it as easy as possible for a beginner-ish user to be able to run a full [Monero] node*. 

To learn more about the project, consult the project's website[^4] and wiki page on Github[^5].
