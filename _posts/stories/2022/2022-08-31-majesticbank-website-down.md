The majesticbank.sc[^1] website seems to be *down* at the moment. 

It is uncertain if this issue is directly connected with the very recent Dread incident[^2].

The Monero community is currently discussing[^3] this update in *-community*[^4] on IRC/Matrix.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/9/2: the MajesticBank handle posted a comment in the *#monero* IRC room: 'we are moving to new datacenter, service should be restored soon'[^5]; the website is still offline.**

**Update 22/10/12: both the clearnet site and onionsite are operational again.**
