*Exodus Wallet*[^1] is not dropping support for Monero, but their software is *not going to have the hard fork supported in time*, according to staff member CryptoEngineerObrien[^2]:

> To clarify something: we are not dropping support for XMR. We're just not going to have the hard fork supported in time for it. Our devs are working on it, though.[^3]

XMR buying, selling and trading will be resumed, but no ETA was provided:

> I don't have an ETA yet. However, it will require a client-side update, which happens on Thursdays/Fridays.[^4]

XMR transactions will *not appear in the immediate post-hardfork period*, according to MRL's Rucknium[^5].

*Note that Exodus Wallet is not open source[^6].*

**Update: Exodus Wallet for desktop is ready with the new version 22.8.26[^7].**
