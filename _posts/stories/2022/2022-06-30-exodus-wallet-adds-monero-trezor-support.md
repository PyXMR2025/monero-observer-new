*Exodus Wallet*[^1] have announced[^2] the release of versions 22.6.30 on mobile and 22.7.1[^3] on desktop with support[^4] for Monero on the Trezor, as promised[^5] by Exodus CEO JP Richardson[^6] back in February:

> Monero on Trezor support - This was a big request that the Monero community made late last year. [..] You can now hold XMR on the Trezor Model T using the Trezor Bridge in Exodus.

Note that Exodus is not fully open source[^7] and Trezor has been under fire at the beginning of this year[^8].
