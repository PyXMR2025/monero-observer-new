sausagenoods[^1] has decided to suddenly close[^2] their CCS funding proposal[^3] to create the *Metronero*[^4] XMR checkout system:

> Shadow people did not like it, they called me mean behind my back and that was enough to keep us away from being merged [..] closed now[^5]

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: sausagenoods has no plans to 'participate in [CCS] again'; read the *-community* (20221222) logs[^6] to better understand Siren's (sausagenoods) dissatisfaction with the CCS.**
