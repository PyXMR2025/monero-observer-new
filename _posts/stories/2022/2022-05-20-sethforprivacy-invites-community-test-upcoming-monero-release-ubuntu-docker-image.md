Sethforprivacy[^1] has invited[^2] the community to test the upcoming major Monero release[^3] for bugs using his Ubuntu Docker image[^4]:

> Using these instructions you can get an Ubuntu VPS up and running on testnet in less than 5m (then a bit longer to sync up to chain-tip).

## Instructions

- Launch Ubuntu 20.04+ VPS anywhere you prefer
- Copy-paste all commands at once
- Watch your testnet node sync and help us test
- Report any bugs or issues you encounter

For more details on how you can get some tXMR (testnet funds) and help test Monero code for bugs before the June 16 *0.18 Flourine Fermi*[^5] release, consult garth_xmr[^6]'s PSA[^7].
