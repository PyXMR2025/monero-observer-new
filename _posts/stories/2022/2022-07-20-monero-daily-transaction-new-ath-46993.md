Daily Monero transactions have reached a new all-time high yesterday with 46,993 confirmed, according to Moneroj.net's translog graph[^1]. 

This number accounts to ~16.78% of Bitcoin's total on-chain transactions (279,950)[^2] for the day.

MRL[^3]'s Rucknium[^4] thinks that the increase is probably *natural*:

> [..] At this time I am not too concerned that the transaction increase is due to a malicious actor.[^5]

The previous ATH of 42,244 was recorded last month, on the 16th of June.
