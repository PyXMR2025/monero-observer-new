Haveno[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of its test network (v0.0.1)[^3]:

> We are happy to announce that it’s now possible to run Haveno and test XMR/crypto and XMR/fiat trades with other users in the network by using Monero’s stagenet and the legacy user interface.

Users can test trades with *various fiat currencies* and BTC, BCH, ETH and LTC.

Note that the platform is currently *not ready for being used with real money/accounts*[^4].

To interact with the community, join the *#haveno*[^5] room on Matrix.

Consult the *installing.md*[^6] file for more details on how to get started with Haveno.
