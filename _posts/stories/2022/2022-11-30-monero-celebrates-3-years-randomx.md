Monero is celebrating 3 years of *RandomX*[^1] today:

> This major release [v0.15.0] is due to the November 30th [2019] network update, which in turn adds a new PoW, RandomX[^2].

The *new* CPU-adapted proof-of-work algorithm successfully replaced *CryptoNight*[^3] and allowed everyone to participate in *consensus generation*:

> ASICs restrict access to the consensus generation. Full stop. Monero, and its RandomX proof of work developed by random internet pirates, is ASIC resistant. This means anyone can participate in consensus generation. So you should.[^4]

Learn more about RandomX on the *Monero Outreach*[^5] website.
