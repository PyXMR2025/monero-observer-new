Monero has entered its *tail emission[^1] era* today[^2], at 2022-06-09 00:28:57 (UTC), after block 2641623[^3] was mined:

```
Current block reward is 0.6 XMR 
375.599904310974 XMR tail-mined so far 
Current annual inflation rate is 0.87019213%
```

The community is celebrating the historic moment everywhere:

> It’s finally here! The Monero #TailEmission starts today! (@Monero)[^4]

> [block 2641623] live long and prosper xmr (zont)[^5]

> Today we depart the path of Bitcoin in a new and significant way (garth)[^6]

> This is an historic moment for Monero and Crypto in general! (MoneroTalk)[^7]

> Tail emission watching page is updated! (sech1)[^8]

> Some day I will tell my grand children's that I was there (CarlitosSaganTime)[^9]

From now on, miner block rewards should be fixed at 0.6 XMR per block, *forever*.
