john_r365[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for improving the bounties.monero.social[^3] website:

> Add bounty funded amount to the home index + bounty header: [..] It would be helpful for all users to have the current bounty total: next to each bounty on the home page / in the header of the bounty page

```
Total Bounty: 0 XMR (to date)
```

To increase the bounty you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2].
