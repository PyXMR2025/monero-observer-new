SChernykh[^1] has set up a P2Pool[^2] testnet in preparation for Monero's v15 hardfork[^3]:

> I've set up a testnet p2pool to check that everything works correctly during the v15 hardfork. Testnet will fork to v15 at block 1982800 (around 08:00 UTC on May 16th).[^4]

According to the project maintainer's public service announcement[^5], *3-4 testers will be enough for the next few days*.

Testers should be able to compile Monero and P2Pool binaries from source[^6]'[^7].

Instructions on how to join the test can be found on Github[^4].
