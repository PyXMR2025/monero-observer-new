melon_crust[^1] has launched a website[^2] for their new *Learn Monero* course content:

> I created this course to offer a comprehensive guide of how Monero works to anyone who's interested in the topic. [..] I’ve already set up a website where I will be uploading all the course content[^3]

### Course overview

```
1. Introduction (4 sections)
2. Money and privacy (6 sections)
3. Math (5 sections)
4. Cryptography (18 sections)
5. Monero Deep Dive (8 sections)
6. Monero Network (4 sections)
```

According to melon_crust, the free course will cover *all the maths and cryptography needed to understand how Monero really works* and the detailed content (mostly videos) should be uploaded soon[^4].

To support the project, you can donate to the XMR address[^5] listed on the website.
