> [..] let's get the 21 million, let's get a Bitcoin standard, let's get everyone on Bitcoin, and then when we can come back, then we could, maybe, add some deeper privacy tools (Peter @ 34:07)

Several topics are covered in this interview, such as: the need for digital privacy, BTC's privacy limitations, verifiable supply, atomic swaps, XMR delistings, maximalism, block size and monetary policy.
