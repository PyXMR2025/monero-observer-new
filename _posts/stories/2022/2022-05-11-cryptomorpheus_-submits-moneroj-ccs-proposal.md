CryptoMorpheus_[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2], looking to improve Moneroj.net, develop the website's article section and cover project maintenance costs:

> I made Moneroj.net for the community out of my own pocket and time, over a year ago, and kept as much as I could updating and improving. I certainly believe that this is a project that deserves some investment, as it is very useful as a tool, and has been increasing in size.

```
Total funding: 70 XMR.

ETA: ~2 months (240 hours).
```

### Milestones

- M1: New server, fix bugs and improve the interface (29 XMR)
- M2: Improve loading speed and deliver new metrics (29 XMR)
- M3: Build new charts with metrics and begin development of articles section (29 XMR)

CryptoMorpheus_ is the creator of Monero metrics project, Moneroj.net[^3], and the the developer behind *Monero.com by Cake Wallet*[^4].
