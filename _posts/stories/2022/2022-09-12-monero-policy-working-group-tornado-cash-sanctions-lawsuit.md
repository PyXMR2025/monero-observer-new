The *Monero Policy Working Group*[^1] has expressed their support[^2] for the *challenge arguing that OFAC and others exceeded their authority in sanctioning open-source technology* after the sanctions levied against Tornado Cash on August 8, 2022:

> Sanctioning open-source projects sets a bad precedent. Monero, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are open-source projects. [..] The lawsuit aims for a judgment that the Tornado Cash sanction designation is null and void, is in excess of the authority granted to Treasury, and is unconstitutional.

To learn more about the Coinbase-funded lawsuit, consult the complaint[^3] against the Department of the Treasury.

Older policy posts are also available as .PDFs in the *MPWG* documents repository[^4].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
