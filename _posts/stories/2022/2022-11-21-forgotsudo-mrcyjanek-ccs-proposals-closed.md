Both Forgotsudo's *Merkato*[^1] and mrcyjanek's XMR payment processor[^2] CCS funding proposals were closed today:

- The Monero community reached consensus to temporarily close Forgotsudo's proposal, *pending resubmission of Web Of trust only*[^3]

- mrcyjanek was closed *due to concerns and lack of interest*[^4]

Consult the previous two *Monero Community Workgroup Meeting* logs[^5]'[^6] to learn more about this development.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
