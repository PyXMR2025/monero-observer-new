pokkst[^1] has forked the Monerujo[^2] Android XMR wallet codebase and started working on a new XMR wallet[^3]:

> It's forked from Monerujo's codebase, but everything besides the XMR C++ library and a few util classes have been deleted so far [..] it is still heavy work in progress.[^4]

The wallet doesn't currently have a name and no other details were provided. Inspect the commits[^5] for more information about the project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

---

**Update: the wallet name is *MyNero*[^6]; initial release was announced[^7].**
