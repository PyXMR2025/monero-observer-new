TheStoicCoiner[^1] has published the first episode[^2] of the new *Monero Magazine*[^3] podcast, a short interview with Sethforprivacy[^4]:

> [..] the only real way I would say Monero has failed is if for some reason its privacy protocol was totally broken and traceable, and we couldn't do anything about it [..] I basically don't think that that's a reality .. (Seth @ 24:15)

Several topics are covered in this interview, including: Layer 2's on Monero, XMR DNM adoption, CBDC's and social credit scores, privacy and freedom.

The Monero Magazine *news sharing website*[^5], a platform that aims to *reward creators of articles with a % of revenue*, is expected to launch next year.

It is worth noting that TheStoicCoiner is also the author of *The Monero Standard* book[^6].
