A new Monero Observer series, *Cypherpunk Transmission*, will replace the weekly XMR TA reports[^1].

The first *CT* will be posted on Monday (October 17) and, if that is well received, the series will become part of the regular schedule.

There are several reasons behind this change:

- cypherpunks are calling; there is a real need for more educational material
- time is limited; can't add another periodical without removing other stuff
- carpal tunnel from wrestling with TradingView's MITM; *Cuckflare*[^2]'[^3]

Note that all 56 XMR TA reports will still be available on the website, for reference.

**-3RA**

*PS: [emotional] thank you for reading my military technical analysis reports for more than a year. ^o^*
