*ErCiccione*[^1] has announced[^2] that he is leaving the *Haveno*[^3] *Core Team* due to *divergences* between him and *Woodser*[^4], the project's lead developer:

> [..] the way we see the project became too big for me to be able to continue to work on Haveno. I’m leaving the Haveno core team effective immediately.

Cake Labs[^5] founder Vik Sharma[^6] will *replace* Erciccione and take over his project responsibilities, which includes *managing the social media accounts and Haveno infrastructure*:

> Everything will continue. Additionally, Cake will cover the CCS shortfall for the completion of the UI. That will be our continued donation to the project. (Vik)[^7]

To better understand the current state of Haveno, consult the most recent Monero Observer reports[^8]'[^9].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
