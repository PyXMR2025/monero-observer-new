selsta[^1] has posted a monthly CCS progress report[^2] for July 2022, which includes the following dev updates:

```
Milestone 3:
- Spent most of my time on network upgrade related work, released v0.18.0.0
- Test v0.18 Ledger and Trezor integration on testnet
- Investigate monero bugs with macOS 13 beta (RandomX and wallet sync issues)
- Sent pull request to MSYS2 package manager to fix monero binaries being static on Windows
```

*Misc* work is not explicitly mentioned in these updates.

A more complete list of changes can be found on Github[^3]'[^4].

This is the final milestone for !312[^5], but selsta has recently submitted a new proposal[^6] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of October 2022.
