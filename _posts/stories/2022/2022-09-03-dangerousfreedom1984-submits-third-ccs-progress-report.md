DangerousFreedom1984[^1] has submitted the third and final progress report[^2] for their CCS[^3] proposal to build Python tools that check for inflation in Monero:

> Finished my CCS project as proposed and did not find any bug that could lead to inflation.

### Progress overview

- Finished writing all the main functions in Python to scan the blockchain focusing on the inflation issue (as proposed).
- [..] scanned the Borromean signatures again to identify all the 'malleable' transactions and wrote this small report here[^4].
- [..] coded the Bulletproofs verification function in RUST (which will be useful for Serai - thank you kayabaNerve for the help) [..]

The full progress report is available on Reddit[^2].

DangerousFreedom1984 is planning to open up a new CCS proposal *soon*, to *help in the development of Jamtis/Seraphis*.

To learn more about DangerousFreedom1984's work, visit the *moneroinflation.com*[^5] website and consult the previous Monero Observer report[^6].
