SoiledCold5[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to add Monero and Wownero to the new *Garlix.io*[^3] crypto trading platform and the upcoming *GarlixPay*[^4] mobile POS app:

> We'd love to add Monero to our site and GarlixPay service, however due to the nature of Monero this will require funding. [..] we already have trading pairs for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.

```
Total funding: 15 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Monero gets added to Garlix.io with accompanying trade pairs. (5 XMR)
- M2: Monero gets added to GarlixPay, available for businesses and websites to use via the GarlixPay API. (7.5 XMR)
- M3: GarlixPay mobile app starts development, and will be released on both the App Store and Google Play. This will allow mobile devices to become crypto point of sale terminals. (15 XMR)

SoiledCold5 has previously announced their intention to list a WOW/XMR trading pair on Garlix, as reported on Monero Observer[^5].
