Miguel Medina (michaelizer[^1]) has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to translate all *Moneropedia*[^3] terms and the *Behavioral Finance, Cryptocurrency Markets*[^4] video subtitles to Spanish:

> Translation of all the Moneropedia terms and the subtitles from the video "Behavioral Finance, Cryptocurrency Markets" into Spanish.

```
Total funding: 14 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones

- Milestone 1: Translation of the subtitles from the video "Behavioral Finance, Cryptocurrency Markets" (10,203 words, 7 XMR)
- Milestone 2: Translation of all the Moneropedia terms (9,367 words, 7 XMR)

michaelizer has been working on Monero translations since November 2020. His other two CCS proposals[^5]'[^6] are still unfinished, mainly due to a lack of reviewers.
