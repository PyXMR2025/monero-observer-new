In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews Janice Dyson McAfee[^4], the wife of late John McAfee:

> I am into Monero [..] just because John was. I will admit I heavily relied on John's expertise when it comes to crypto [..] I'm also obviously biased towards 'GHOST' [..] it was created to be wrapped in Monero protocol.. (Janice @ 19:43)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including crypto and parallel economies, living off the grid, John's life, death, and philosophy.

MoneroTalk has also previously interviewed John McAfee, in a November 2019 episode[^5].
