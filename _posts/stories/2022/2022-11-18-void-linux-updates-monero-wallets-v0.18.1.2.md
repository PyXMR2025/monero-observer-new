A Void Linux[^1] team member has merged[^2] kevcrumb's PR[^3] to update the Monero CLI and GUI wallet packages[^4] to the latest version (0.18.1.2) earlier today:

> Our update to Monero 0.18 has been accepted, meaning that Void and Split Linux users alike can again rely on their package manager to obtain the version compatible with the current Monero network. (kevcrumb)[^5]

kevcrumb[^6] is the creator and maintainer of the Void-based *Split Linux*[^7], an operating system *optimized for safely navigating hostile environments*.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: kevcrumb posted some background info for the Monero community[^8].**
