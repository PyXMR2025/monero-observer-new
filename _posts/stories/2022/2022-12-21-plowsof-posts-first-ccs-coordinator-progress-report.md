plowsof[^1] has submitted the first progress report[^2] after working for more than a month as CCS coordinator[^3]:

> Work started during the funding stage however this update will cover what has happened since being fully funded. [..] I would like to now say thank you to all of you who donated to my proposal, sent messages of support and helped share it. [..] Any questions or 'you should focus on this' / 'do better' please let me know.

### Work summary

- [CCS] 3 community meetings, 4 proposals funded (GUPAX, selsta, Jberman, MoneroKon23), 1 moved forward with the requested changes (SoloptXMR)[^4]
- [Testing] After creating sanity check scripts for scan_tx in the CLI[^5]/GUI[^6] I've been using it as my daily driver (along with background-sync) and have not had any issues.
- [Site] updating the wallet/daemon/docs/guides[^7]
- [Misc] Bulletproofs++ review/audit legwork, put up 2 community nodes (node.monerodevs.org and node2.monerodevs.org (ports 18089/28089/38089)), stepped in to make sure payments are released when bounties are completed on bounties.monero.social [..]

The full progress report is available on Gitlab[^2].
