In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Luke Parker (*kayabaNerve*)[^3], on developing *Serai*[^4], the cross-chain decentralized exchange:

> [..] while I do love atomic swaps [..] I don't feel the community actually wants atomic swaps, which is a brutal truth .. (Luke @ 35:50)

Luke will present and answer questions related to Serai in a NYC Monero Meetup event on August 9th, as previously reported[^5]. 

The project is also currently looking for developers to hire *accordingly*[^6].

*This report will be updated as soon as part 2/2 of the interview is uploaded on the Monero Talk channel.*

**Update: part 2/2 available[^7].**
