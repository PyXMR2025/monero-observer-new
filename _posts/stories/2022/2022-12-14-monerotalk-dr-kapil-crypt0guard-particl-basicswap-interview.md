In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews Dr Kapil Amarasinghe[^4] and crypt0guard[^5]:

> [..] if you look at the fundamentals of proof-of-work [..] what's the consequence of running smart contracts on the actual blockchain itself: you lose X, you lose Y, you lose Z. Let's move that off. [..] to get real privacy can be really a fucking pain in the balls, but it's so worth it! (Dr Kapil @ 37:45)

Both guests are part of the *blockchain-based privacy project* Particl[^6]: Dr Kapil is a project advisor and crypt0guard is one of the project managers. 

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including Particl and its built-in messaging system, BasicSwap DEX[^7], Monero, and reducing the risks of using decentralized exchanges. 

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^8] to learn more about BasicSwap.
