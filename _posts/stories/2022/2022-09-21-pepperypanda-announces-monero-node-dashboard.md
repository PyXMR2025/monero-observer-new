PepperyPanda[^1] has announced[^2] a new *Monero Node Dashboard*[^3] application for local XMR nodes:

> Inspired by jnbarlow/monero-dashboard, I made a Monero Node Dashboard. Shows some simple data from your (restricted) node. Feedback is welcome!

A restricted node demo is available on Vercel[^4] and installation instructions can be found on Github[^3].
