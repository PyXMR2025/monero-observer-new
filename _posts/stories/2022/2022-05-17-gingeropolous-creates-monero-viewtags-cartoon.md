Gingeropolous[^1] has created a funny cartoon[^2] that explains the concept of *view tags*[^3]:

> so I saw some chat somewhere that suggested that viewtags were kinda hard to understand; so i made a dumb cartoon[^4]

> the non-zoidberg content i release under WTFPL, so if someone wants to actually animate it that'd be cool[^5]

The core idea was proposed by UkoeHB[^6] and implemented by j-berman[^7]. The optimization will be added to Monero in the next v15 network upgrade[^8] and should reduce wallet scanning time.

View tags are currently visible on the testnet[^9]:

To learn more about the technical details, consult issue #73[^10] in the MRL repository and j-berman's insightful thread[^11].
