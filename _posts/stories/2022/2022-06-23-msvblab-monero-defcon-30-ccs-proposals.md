Michael Schloh von Bennewitz[^1] has submitted two separate CCS proposal[^2]'[^3] to procure and distribute merchandise and serve Monero content to *thirty thousand visitors* at the *DEF CON 30*[^4] hacking conference in Las Vegas on August 11-14 2022:

> This CCS proposal absorbs most of the costs of serving Monero content to thirty thousand visitors at the Defcon hacker conference in Las Vegas (30th anniversary.) [..] This CCS relates only to the production of the stand itself, the display rack of Monero project information, and the on site delivery. (!325[^2])

> This CCS proposal absorbs most the costs of providing a number of Defcon visitors with free of charge Monero branded merchandise. [..] The funded amount will be paid in one milestone, to allow staff to purchase merchandise in time for distribution in August 2022. (!326[^3])

```
CCS !325 (Production and delivery)

Total funding proposed: 108 XMR.

CCS !326 (Merchandise purchasing)

Total funding proposed: 375 XMR.
```

### Budgets

!325 budget should cover staff accommodation, entrance badges, air travel, food, the stand area and other similar items.

!326 budget is allocated to merchandise purchasing: fashion items, books, electronics, and collectibles.

### Staff

The staff members will be Michael Schloh von Bennewitz (MSvB), *Cryptovangurlie*, and *a third Moneron*:

> These people staffed the Konferenco and Cryptocurrency Village[^5] at Defcon last year. [..] You can find us in the vendor area near the west docks of Caesars Forum.

To learn more, ask questions and support the two proposals, consult !325[^2] and !326[^3].

**Update 22/6/25: proposals were slightly altered[^6]'[^7] to remove the *third Moneron* from the staff and *adapt costs*.**

**Update 22/7/22: proposals closed (expired).**
