The MoneroMarket[^1] project plans to launch its website in 1 week, according to an announcement[^2] from xmradmin[^3]:

> MoneroMarket website (buy and sell legal items + escrow) will be released in 1 week 

Besides screenshots for the frontpage, listings, wallet, orders, transactions, and other website sections, no other links or details were including in the announcement thread.

It is unclear if this is the same MoneroMarket project that was announced by Janoher[^4] last year, as previously reported[^5].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: website[^1] is now online; related discussions on IRC[^6] and Reddit[^7]; note that escrow is custodial.**
