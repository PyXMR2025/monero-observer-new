lescuer97[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue developing	and improving COMIT's XMR-BTC atomic swap project (*xmr-btc-swap*[^3]):

> This development will focus on various things but the biggest are the creation of an RFC API for the swap-cli. This will help people like binarybaron who is making the GUI have better interaction with the tool.[^4]

```
Total funding: 65 XMR (€65/h).

ETA (hours): 6 months (~25 Hrs/week).
```

### Milestones

- M1: Completed new features (10 XMR)
- M2: Fixed important bugs (30 XMR)
- M3: Support development: Minor bugs and dependency updates (15 XMR, 3 months)
- M4: ASB docker (10 XMR)

lescuer97 started maintaining the project in April, alongside BinaryBaron[^5] and delta1[^6], after responding to COMIT's *Looking for maintainers* announcement. Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7] for more information.
