Particl[^1] has finally released the *BasicSwap DEX*[^2] open beta, *after nearly two years of research and development*:

> It happened! [..] the open beta of the BasicSwap DEX is now publicly available on mainnet![^3]

The platform currently supports XMR, BTC, PART, PIVX, FIRO, DASH and LTC.

### Features overview

- Native Monero support
- No KYC
- No swap/DEX fees
- Non-custodial infrastructure
- No central liquidity pool (P2P trades)
- Cross-chain atomic swaps
- Encrypted data/metadata 
- Tor support[^4]

BasicSwap's *entirely decentralized* atomic swap process is powered by Particl's custom P2P messaging network, *SMSG (SecureMessaging)*[^5].

To learn more about the project, visit *basicswapdex.com*[^6], consult the installation guide[^7], and connect with the community on Matrix/Discord/Telegram[^8].

It is relevant to note that users have to compile and run their own *full BasicSwap nodes* and XMR swaps are *currently limited to the 'coin from' side of the protocol*.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: Particl posts new BasicSwap article: *HTLC-Based (“Secret Hash”) Swaps vs Adaptor Signature Swaps in BasicSwap*[^9].**
