monerobull[^1] has introduced[^2] a new *guerrilla* funding option[^3] on the monerosupplies.com[^4] shop:

> [..] introduced a new option that is aimed at people who are willing to place hundreds of Monero stickers out in the streets but might not have the funds to do so.[^5]

Users can either fund a guerrilla (25 EUR), or get funded and receive a subsidized (0.50 EUR + shipping) 680 sticker package. 

A new *Combo-Pack "Anonymous Money" + "History"*[^6] is also available in the shop.
