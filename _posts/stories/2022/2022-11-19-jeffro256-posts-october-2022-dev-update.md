jeffro256[^1] has posted the second progress report (M2/October 2022)[^2] for their Monero dev work CCS proposal[^3]:

> Howdy, I'm back again with another milestone update! [..] This month I mainly worked on the community node goal.

### Work overview

- began writing the community node selection code[^4]
- started on writing the NodeRPCProxy refactorings[^5]'[^6]'[^7] [..]

A list of relevant authored and reviewed pull requests is available in the report[^2].

For the next milestone period, jeffro256 plans on *fleshing out the node selection code, pushing more NodeRPCProxy refactorings through, and adding that support to the GUI wallet*.
