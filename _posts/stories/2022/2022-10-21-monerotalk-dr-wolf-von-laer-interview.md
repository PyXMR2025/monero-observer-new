> [..] you have a trade-off between privacy and then also the accountability, because if everything is completely private, how do I know that like not people at Monero are gonna increase the money supply? Can I verify that at any given point in time? (Dr. Wolf von Laer @ 11:25)

Several topics are discussed in this short interview, including the war against cash, libertarianism vs totalitarianism, Bitcoin vs Monero and CBDCs.
