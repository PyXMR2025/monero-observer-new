Spirobel[^1] has published an article on Monerochan.News[^2] in which he interviews Andres[^3], a Monerujo[^4] developer, on what makes the Android wallet *special*:

> It's truly a passion project, built by a few Monero believers in their free time which even became friends. We believe private, self-custodied money is something worth having in the world, and without the proper tools to interact with it, it'll fail.

This is the fifth in a series of interviews that are currently available on the website[^5]:

- Monero translator Yiota on building local communities
- Serai developer Luke Parker on how he started his career
- Anarkio Crypto on building a circular economy with Monero
- Luke Parker breaks down the Monero burning bug and how we can fix it

Discuss the story on *forum.monerochan.news*[^6].
