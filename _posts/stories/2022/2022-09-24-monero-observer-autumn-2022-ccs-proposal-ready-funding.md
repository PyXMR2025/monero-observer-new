After community review, the Monero Observer CCS proposal for Autumn 2022 has been moved to the next stage and is now ready for funding:

> I will continue to maintain Monero Observer (https://monero.observer) for the next 3 months (autumn 2022): September, October and November.

```
10 contributors raised 30 XMR (100%)
```
