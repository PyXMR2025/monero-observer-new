CryptoMorpheus_[^1] has decided to cancel[^2] the Moneroj.net[^3] CCS proposal[^4], deploy most of the promised website improvements and new charts for free, and rely on direct XMR donations instead:

> I'm delivering most of what I promised in my CCS proposal, and I just want some help from the community to keep me motivated to build more.[^5]

Since the project will not be funded via the CCS, otherwise *questionable* content can also be included on the website, like darknet market metrics. 

### Improvements

- hidden service[^6] for TOR users
- severely reduced use of Javascript
- completely rebuilt database, faster page load time (95.4% reduction from 494s to 22.7s)
- 24 (10[^7]+14) new charts added since submitting the CCS proposal on May 11th (70 total[^8])
- new *Gazeto Moneroj*[^9] Articles section discussing metrics and the banking system
- new user registration system (article submission)
- improved site *visual identity* and some serious bugfixes

Read the full announcement post[^5] to learn more about this update.

To support CryptoMorpheus_'s work and keep the Moneroj.net project free for everyone, donate XMR to the address listed on the About[^10] page.
