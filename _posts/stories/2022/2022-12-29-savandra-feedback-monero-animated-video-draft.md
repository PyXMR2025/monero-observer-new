savandra[^1] is currently looking for feedback[^2] on a new Monero animated video[^3] *rough draft*:

> I created the animatic for the first video. It's a rough draft, and of course, it's just a placeholder voice-over. [..] These scenes are to be modified and extended to be used in future vids. Looking forward to hearing from you guys [..]

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4] to learn more about savandra's CCS proposal[^5].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 23/1/23: video voiceover script drafts ready for final community review[^6].**
