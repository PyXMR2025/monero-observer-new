Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has posted his May-June 2022 dev report[^2] for community review:

> I spent the contracted time on reviews, maintaining my still open branches and fortunately on Monero Research Lab's task of reimplementing the Decoy Algorithm.

The report also addresses ongoing controversy[^3]'[^4] surrounding the associated CCS proposal[^5] and includes an hourly accounting report for milestones #2 and #3.

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^6]'s *Layman's Guide*[^7] and consult the previous Monero Observer report[^8].
