pluja[^1] has announced[^2] a new and improved version of the *ISeeYour.cash*[^3] experimental search engine project:

> Today I'm happy to show you the new version of iseeyour.cash. It has been down for quite a while, until now. [..] I made this site to show users some of the risks of transparent blockchains and to show the benefits of using Monero.

## Changes

```
- Much faster speeds than the previous version (~4s on the first search, <2s in future searches).
- Lighter UI.
- Improved scalability using MongoDB as a database.
- Reverse search, meaning you can input an address in the search field and (if present in the database) you will be able to see the user that owns the address.
- Better scrapping and fewer requests.
- Twitter support only.
- Easy self-hosting with docker-compose (and better documentation on how-to).
- Zero Javascript, no trackers, no logs.
```

Planned features include: support for Reddit, rich lists, total user funds, option to display full database content and REST API.

The code is open source on Codeberg[^4] and anyone can contribute. 

pluja is also the maintainer of other projects like kycnot.me[^5], awesome-privacy[^6], Feetter[^7] and is currently working on moneroj.info[^8] and monero.boats[^9].

To support their work, you can donate some XMR to the address[^10] listed on the *ISYC* website.
