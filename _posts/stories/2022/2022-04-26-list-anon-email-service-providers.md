## Motivation

After cTemplar announced they are shutting down, people started worrying and fleeing back to Protonmail and other mainstream providers. 

There is a problem: most of them are not very good options from a privacy perspective. 

It is not a secret that email itself is fundamentally broken: even if encrypted, protocol-generated metadata is still vulnerable to security breaches and any capable third party can intercept the data and do whatever they want with it.

Unfortunately we are still forced to use email sometimes. 

This is my attempt to create (and maintain) a short list of email service providers that might be of interest to some anons.

## Legend

*Notes: All should work with Tor (signup and login), be able to communicate with clearnet email servers (sending/receiving), not require an email address to signup and not use Cloudflare. All encryption claims are ignored (you should always encrypt locally).*

```
(F): Free plan
(O): Onion address
(X): Accepts XMR for paid plans
(I): Instant account creation
(R): Reliable (relatively good uptime)
(P): Good Privacy Policy (logs)
```

## The list

- [^1] **Disroot** (F)(R)(P) *[@disroot.org]*
- [^2] **Posteo** (I)(R)(P) *[@posteo.net & more]*
- [^3] **Danwin1210** (F)(O)(I) *[@danwin1210.de]*
- [^4] **DNMX** (F)(O)(I)(P) *[@dnmx.org]*

I will try and keep this list up to date. Let me know if this is helpful and send me any suggestions @[/about](/about#signature) (use XMPP if possible).
