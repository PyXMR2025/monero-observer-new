An anonymous contributor has donated 2500 XMR (~$381K USD)[^1] to the Monero General Fund address[^2].

plowsof's *monero-fund-watch*[^3] Python script tweeted the donation alert:

> 💝 +2500. #xmr 💝 $381425.00[^4]

Some people in the community suspect that *stillhuntingshorts*[^5] is the benefactor. 

The user joined Gitlab yesterday and posted a comment in moneromooo-monero's *monero-site* #2013[^6] PR just a few minutes after the transfer was completed:

> We are Monero 888tNk.... +****.0089[^7]

The message quotes selsta's post[^8]:

> There is no way the general fund has 300k-400k to buy a domain name. That's like half the general fund.

Previously, Vik Sharma from Cake Labs suggested that he was *open to selling the domain monero.com to the Monero core team*[^9]. Cake paid *around $400,000*[^10] for the monero.com domain.

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^11] for more context on that story. 

The Monero community is currently discussing this event in *-community*[^12] on IRC/Matrix.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
