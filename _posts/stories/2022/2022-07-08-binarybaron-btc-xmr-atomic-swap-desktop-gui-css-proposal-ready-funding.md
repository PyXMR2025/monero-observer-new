binarybaron[^1]'s second CCS proposal[^2] to continue developing the XMR-BTC atomic swap desktop GUI prototype[^3] for 4 months is now ready for funding[^4]:

```
37 contributors raised 232 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^4] page.
