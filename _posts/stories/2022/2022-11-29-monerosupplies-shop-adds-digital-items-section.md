monerobull[^1] has announced[^2] the addition of a new *Digital items*[^3] section to the monerosupplies.com[^4] shop:

> It is supposed to be a sort of platform for people in the Monero community (but also outside of it), where you can list digital items either for free together with a donation-address or alternatively sell them for Monero without any fees (outside of network fees).

Reach out via email[^5] to have your items listed on the page.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
