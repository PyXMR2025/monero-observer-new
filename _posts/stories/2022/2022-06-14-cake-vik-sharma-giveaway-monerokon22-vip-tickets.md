Cake Labs[^1]'s founder Vik Sharma[^2] will not attend[^3] the upcoming MoneroKon22[^4] (18-19 June) event and is looking to give away his 2 *personal* VIP tickets to the top two winners of a Monero *Trivia Night*[^5] game:

> Trivia is played live using Kahoot. You'll need a phone or web browser to play. Most questions are multiple choice. You get more points for answering quickly![^6]

The trivia will be played at noon CT / 17 UTC and will cover Monero's history, technology, and current events. 

Read the announcement[^6] for more details and join tomorrow's livestream[^4] to participate in the trivia.

Note that Cake Wallet[^7] is still one of the main sponsors of the event.
