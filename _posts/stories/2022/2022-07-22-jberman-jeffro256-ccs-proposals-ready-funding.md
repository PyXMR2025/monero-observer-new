jberman[^1]'s and jeffro256[^2]'s CCS proposals[^3]'[^4] have been moved to the funding stage and are now looking for community support:

- jberman wants to continue full time development work on Monero for 3 months[^5]
- jeffro256 wants to work part-time on Monero development for 3 months[^6]

You can support them by donating to the XMR addresses listed on the *Funding Required* page[^3]'[^4].

**Update 22/7/23: binaryFate sent 37.5 XMR (20% of whole amount) to jberman's CCS proposal from the Monero General Fund[^7].**

**Update 22/7/24: both CCS proposals were fully funded.**
