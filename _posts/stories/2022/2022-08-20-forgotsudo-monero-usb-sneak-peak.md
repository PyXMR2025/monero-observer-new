ForgotSudo[^1] has shared[^2] a sneak peak of a Monero USB flash drive that could be released *before the end of the year*:

> I am currently designing and will be producing an assortment of electronics catered toward the Monero community. The picture is a sneak peek of the USB flash drive in the works. 

Costs will be around $7-$10 per USB and the money would be used to fund Merkato, the Onionr[^3] decentralized marketplace. 

This is only one of *many to come* PCBs (printed circuit boards)[^4] that ForgotSudo plans on designing, prototyping and producing for the Monero community.

A CCS proposal for this project should be submitted *soon*.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: CCS proposal was submitted[^5].**
