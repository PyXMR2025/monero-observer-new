Ghostnet[^1] has announced[^2] their new *grassroots P2P crypto marketplace*[^3] platform with a *special focus on privacy* and Monero:

> You can sell through us like Amazon, or publish your own direct classifieds entry, 100% free to list.

The platform lists a wide range of services on their website, including *De-Googled Phones*, cryptocurrency consulting, classifieds[^4] and an *Encrypted Bulletin Board*[^5].

Ghostnet currently charges a 5% fee per market sale and $10+ for hosting encrypted files and broadcasted text.

Monero payments are processed via NOWPayments[^6] and the website is accessible on Tor, but the UX is currently subpar.

*Note that this is a new service with no established reputation. Proceed with caution and DYOR.*
