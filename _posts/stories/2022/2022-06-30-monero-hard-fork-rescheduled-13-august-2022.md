Monero should undergo a network upgrade (v15 HF) on August 13th 2022 at block 2688888, the devs have decided in today's *Monero Development Workgroup* meeting[^1].

### New Dates

```
~July 13 - 0.18 release (Fluorine Fermi)
~August 13 - Mainnet hard fork (v15)
```

As previously reported[^2], Monero was originally set to hard fork on July 16th, but the 0.18 release was delayed mainly due to hardware wallet and multi-sig audit delays.

To learn more about the reasons behind the delay, read the logs/summary for the 22 June MRL meeting[^3] and today's Dev meeting[^1]. 

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4] for information about the v15 hard fork.

**Update: network upgrade was completed[^5].**
