Monero contributor and XMR.ru[^1] mod v1docq47[^2] has posted his CCS[^3] progress report[^4] for April-May 2022:

> This is my April + May CCS progress report + work on XMR.RU. Due to the fact that Reddit stubbornly blocked the publication of my previous report, I had to post it as a comment to my CCS proposal.

v1docq47 is currently creating tutorial videos and translating various Monero content into Russian. Consult my previous report[^5] for more information about his CCS proposal. 

The complete list of v1docq47's contributions can be found on Trello[^6] and Weblate[^7].
