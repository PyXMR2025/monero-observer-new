hennyh[^1] has successfully restored the functionality of bounties.monero.social[^2] site and won the 5 XMR bounty[^3] offered by xmrvsbeast[^4]:

> This bounty is to serve as a reward for getting functionality back to the Monero bounties site. Thanks to @hennyh:matrix.org for stepping up to tackle this important task! (xmrvsbeast)[^5]

The website's bounties bot stopped working in March, as previously reported[^6]. 

To help increase hennyh's reward and test the bot at the same time, you can donate some XMR to the address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^5].

To learn more about the Monero Bounties project, consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7].
