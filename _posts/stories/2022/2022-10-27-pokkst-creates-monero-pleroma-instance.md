pokkst[^1] has started[^2] hosting a new Pleroma instance (xmrposter.club[^3]) dedicated to Monero users:

> A place for Monero users to discuss, hangout, share ideas, shitpost, and more. Non-Monero users are welcome too.

The instance can also be accessed via Tor[^4] and I2P[^5].

Note that email is required for registration, but apparently a burner address is permitted.

pokkst is also currently developing the *MyNero Wallet*[^6] and maintaining the *Monero Decoy Scanner*[^7] script. To support their work, you can donate XMR to the address listed on the xmrposter.club About page[^8].
