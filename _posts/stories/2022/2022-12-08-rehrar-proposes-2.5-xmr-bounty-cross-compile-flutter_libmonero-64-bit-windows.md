Cypher Stack[^1] founder rehrar[^2] has proposed[^3] a 2.5 XMR bounty for cross-compiling *flutter_libmonero for 64-bit Windows from Linux*:

> Cypher Stack is wrapping Monero's source code for use in Dart by Flutter apps (like Stack Wallet)! Cross-compiling to Windows has been a challenge so we are coming to the community to ask for help. 

### Bounty requirements

- Cross-compile flutter_libmonero for use on 64-bit Windows
- Link statically (no external dependencies)
- Library must be able to be loaded in Dart like `DynamicLibrary.open("libcw_monero.dll")` without errors
- Work must be reproducible by the Cypher Stack team

Consult the *README*[^4] file on Github to get involved with the project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: bounty increased to 10 XMR[^5].**
