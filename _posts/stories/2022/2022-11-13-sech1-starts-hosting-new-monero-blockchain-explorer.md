sech1[^1] has started hosting a new Monero blockchain explorer at *p2pool.io/explorer*[^2]:

> In light of xmrchain.net being down for a while recently, I've spun up a block explorer [..] It will be running as a backup explorer for everyone in case xmrchain.net is down again, and as a main explorer for p2pool.io itself.[^3]

The popular xmrchain.net[^4] explorer is still offline at the moment, but *it won't be down permanently*, according to gingeropolous[^5], the server *co-admin*. The community is speculating[^6] that the downtime might be connected to Hetzner's anti-crypto policies.

sech1 urges projects in the Monero ecosystem to make use of the *onion-monero-blockchain-explorer* open source software and start hosting more blockchain explorer instances:

> [..] it's really easy to have your own explorer instance and be independent of 3rd party outages [..]

A hidden service for the new P2Pool Monero block explorer will be available *tomorrow*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: P2Pool Monero onion block explorer deployed[^8]; xmrchain.net is back online.**
