rayatina[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to host a digital *Libre Library*, XMR nodes, and maintain an *archive* of the Monero *source code and docs*:

> With Monero Being A Controversial Currency, The Worry For It To Become Outlawed Is Very Real, So We Believe Archiving Monero's Source Code And Docs Would Be The Best Way To Circumvent Any Sanctioning Of Monero.

```
Total funding: 14-15 XMR (TBD).

ETA: <1 year (Nov 23 2023 deadline).
```

### Milestones

- M1: Buy Server To Host Library And Post First Books (4.6 XMR)
- M2: Archive XMR Source Code And Docs, Run An XMR Node. (4.6 XMR)
- M3: Create Backup of Server And Pay For Moderation (4.8 XMR)

It is unclear what kind of books will be posted in the *library* since no other details were provided, but we should expect *a usable site by early 2023*.

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !361[^2].
