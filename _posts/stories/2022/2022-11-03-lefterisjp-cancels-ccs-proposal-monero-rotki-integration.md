LefterisJP[^1] has decided to cancel[^2] the CCS funding proposal[^3] to integrate Monero into *Rotki*[^4]:

> The quoted price is how much it would cost for our team to work on this [..] judging from the comments and the aggressiveness this won't go anywhere and as such out of respect of your time and ours I am closing the proposal.

The Monero community was mainly questioning the proposal's *hefty price tag*[^5] (532 XMR). 	

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^6] to learn more about this CCS.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
