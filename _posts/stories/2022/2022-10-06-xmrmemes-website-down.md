XmrMemes.com[^1], the *Monero meme site*, seems to be down at the moment. 

*monerodirectory*[^2] has been maintaining the project since it was funded via the CCS[^3] last year.

Note that both CCS milestones have been completed: 

- M1: *Finish Site and Launch it*
- M2: *Market Website and Get 1st 50 Memes* 

The website's source code[^4] was released under the MIT License so anyone can attempt to *revive* the project.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available. Monero Observer reached out to monerodirectory for comment.*
