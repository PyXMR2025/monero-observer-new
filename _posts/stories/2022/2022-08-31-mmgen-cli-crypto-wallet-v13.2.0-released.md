Version 13.2.0[^1] of the *MMGen*[^2] online/offline command-line cryptocurrency wallet was released with the following new features:

  * Transaction history
  * Import/export tracking wallets to JSON
  * Fast blockchain rescanning via `scantxoutset`
  * Two new `mmgen-xmrwallet` operations: `new` and `list` [..]

The software is compatible with `monerod`[^3] (v0.18.1.0) and was tested on Debian 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Arch Linux and other operating systems.

MMGen supports Monero transacting and wallet management via the interactive `mmgen-xmrwallet`[^4] command.

Consult the release notes[^1] and the project's *README*[^5] file for more details.

*Note: inspect the code before using, if you can read Python.*
