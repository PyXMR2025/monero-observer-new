l0nelyc0w[^1] has shared a design document[^2] that *visualizes* how PenumbraDEX[^3] will operate: 

> Design of federating protocol: A protocol that would allow the seednodes of operators of different Penumbra networks to intercommunicate in order to increase censorship resistance and move closer to structurally being a true DEX.

To learn more and get involved with the Penumbra project, join the *#penumbra* and *#penumbra-dex* Matrix channels[^4] and consult the previous Monero Observer report[^5].
