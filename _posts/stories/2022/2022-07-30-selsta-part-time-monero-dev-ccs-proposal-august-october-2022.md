selsta[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of October 2022:

> Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months (from August to end of October) at a rate of 45€ / hour. At 148€ / XMR (14 day EMA) this makes 110 XMR.

```
Total funding: 110 XMR.

ETA: (end of) October 2022.
```

He plans to focus on preparing the next network update (Testing Ledger and Trezor integration, prepare v0.18.1.0), testing and reviewing PR's and other smaller dev work on the CLI and GUI. 

selsta has contributed over 572 merged commits to both the CLI[^3] and GUI[^4] codebases since 2018.
