In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Elizabeth Binks (aka *noot*)[^3]'[^4], on developing an Ethereum to Monero atomic swaps implementation[^5]:

> [..] finishing the swap [..] that is my first priority. After that I think I would be interested in looking into the Monero [..] actual client implementation (09:02)

Elizabeth has recently completed the 5th milestone[^6] for the associated CCS proposal[^7] and expects the project to be finalized by the end of the year.

To test the WiP ETH-XMR atomic swaps implementation locally or on Monero's stagenet and Ethereum's Goerli testnet, read the Github repository's *README.md*[^8] instructions.
