The *Monero Community Workgroup* video channel[^1] has uploaded UkoeHB[^2]'s Seraphis code walkthrough video[^3]:

> A recording of a technical demo/conversation on Seraphis presented by koe on 2022-10-24. This is a highly technical demo. Seraphis is a forthcoming transaction protocol change to Monero alongside JAMTIS.

To learn more about Seraphis[^4], read the *What is Seraphis, and Why Should You Care?*[^5] Getmonero.org blog post.

Join the *#monero-research-lab*[^6] chatrooms on Matrix/IRC to discuss the technology.
