anhdres[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to create *Monero Garden*[^3], a beginner-friendly XMR educational website:

> The Monero Garden would initially be a website available at monero.garden, that worked as a clean and friendly space to start someone's Monero journey. [..] Its language, both visual and writing, should be approachable for a 11 year old and above.

```
Total funding: 71 XMR.

ETA: ~3 months.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Texts and structure done (30 XMR)
- M2: Illustrations and animations done (30 XMR)
- M3: Website up (11 XMR)

anhdres has been an active member of the Monero community since 2017. His contributions include content creation, illustrations and UX work, various interviews and public talks. More details are available on his website[^4].
