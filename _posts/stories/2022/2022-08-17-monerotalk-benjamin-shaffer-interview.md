In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews Goldback[^4]'s *Legal Counsel*, Benjamin Shaffer[^5], on *bringing new monetary technology to the world stage*:

> [..] you can't have a free market without a free market currency. If your currency can be manipulated, if it can be confiscated, if it can be weaponized against you, then you really don't have money - what you have is a social credit system. [..] this is why Monero and Goldbacks are both solving a similar problem, just in slightly different ways. (Benjamin @ 00:10)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including similarities and differences between Monero and Goldbacks, the minting process and buying Goldbacks with XMR.
