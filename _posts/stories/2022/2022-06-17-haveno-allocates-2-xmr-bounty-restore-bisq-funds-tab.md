Haveno[^1] has allocated a 2 XMR bounty[^2] for restoring the *Funds* tab of the legacy *Bisq*[^3] desktop app UI:

> This tab was removed since it wasn't adapted to the XMR wallet. However, many parts are compatible with XMR with minimal adaptation. Restoring and adapting this tab to XMR will help launch a test network before the new interface is ready.

Anyone can participate and the bounty will be awarded to the first person who resolves this issue.

Before starting any work, a comment in #319[^2] is necessary, so the issue can be assigned to you.

Full conditions can be found in the `bounties.md`[^4] file.
