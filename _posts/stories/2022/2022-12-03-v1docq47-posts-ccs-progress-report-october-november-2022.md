Monero contributor and XMR.ru[^1] mod v1docq47[^2] has posted his CCS[^3] progress report[^4] for October-November 2022:

> [..] this is my October + November CCS progress report with voice-over and works on XMR.RU. [..] If you have suggestions or advice about my work, I will be glad to listen to them.

v1docq47 has also recently translated CryptoMorpheus_'s *Trocador.app* into Russian[^5] *completely free of charge*.

The complete list of v1docq47's contributions can be found on Trello[^6]. 

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7] to learn more about the associated CCS proposal.
