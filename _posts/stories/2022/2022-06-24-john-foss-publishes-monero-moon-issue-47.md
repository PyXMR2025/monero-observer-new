John Foss[^1] has published Issue #47[^2] of *The Monero Moon* curated weekly newsletter:

> This issue of the Monero Moon attempts to cover all the important news over the past two weeks. It is highly likely some information may have been missed due to myself attending MoneroKon 2022 and the impact of travel.

The weekly publication includes news about:

- Development, Releases, and Technology
- General News
- Events
- Exchanges and Merchants
- Community Crowdfunding
- Trading & Speculation
- Performance
- Entertainment
