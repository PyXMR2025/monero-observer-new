MasFlam[^1] has open sourced[^2]'[^3] the code for their *MoneroChad*[^4] Discord bot:

> I have recently made a Discord bot I called Monero Chad. It has been serving Bananaboat's Monero Discord server for some time now, and I decided I should open source it. It is licensed under AGPLv3, and it lives
on GitHub

Deployment instructions and available commands can be found on Github[^4].

Note that the software has not been audited. Inspect the code before using, if you can read Java.
