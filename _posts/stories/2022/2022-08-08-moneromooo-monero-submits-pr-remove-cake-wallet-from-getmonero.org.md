moneromooo-monero[^1], the legendary[^2] Monero contributor, has submitted a pull request[^3] to the *monero-site*[^4] repository to remove Cake Wallet[^5] from the Getmonero.org website Downloads[^6] section:

> This is principled removal, on the grounds that the Cake wallet people are squatting the monero.com domain to push a version of Cake wallet they call the "monero.com" wallet. [..] Having worked for the Monero project for YEARS of my life, I feel pretty aggrieved by this dishonesty, and thus I am registering my protest by this patch[^3]

As previously reported[^7], the *Monero.com*[^8] XMR-only wallet was released in January 2022 and the community also voiced concerns over the domain name back then, but Cake assured everyone that *there will be no confusion* and, according to Cake Wallet's CEO Vik Sharma[^9], it will *not in any way compete with Getmonero.org*.

The issue resurfaced recently, after Justin Ehrenhofer[^10]'s PR[^11] to add Monero.com to the official Getmonero.org website was criticised by the community.

Cake Wallet's new *CakePay*[^12] privacy policy (by Ionia)[^13] only added more fuel to the fire:

> In particular my concern is with with the "marketing" and affiliate sections in ionia.docsend.com/view/jaqsmbq9w7dzvnqf [..] As a result of the above I cannot support or endorse Cakepay. This of course has nothing to do with the non custodial functions of Cakewallet (ArticMine)[^14]

In response, Vik stated that the Cake Labs team *will talk with Ionia*[^15] about the privacy policy, posted a reply on Github addressing Cake Wallet data collection concerns, and agreed to clarify that Monero.com is not the official Getmonero.org website:

> We do not ask for or collect any information on the user or devices as stated in our privacy policy. [..] As far as making it more clear on monero.com website, that its not the official thing, yes we can do that.[^16]

Consult the IRC/Matrix discussion logs[^17]'[^18] and the previous Monero Observer reports[^7]'[^19] for more context and details about this story. 

To engage in constructive discussions and voice your own opinion, comment in PR's #2007[^11] and #2013[^3].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/8/9: According to Vik, Monero.com will be *putting a banner RIGHT at the top today/tomorrow which will clearly direct people to the open source monero project website*[^20]; added context to ArticMine quote.**

**Update 22/8/10: Monero.com adds frontpage banner linking to Getmonero.org, Cake Labs is *open to selling the domain monero.com to the Monero core team at cost [..] under the condition it be used only to redirect to the official site*[^21].**

**Update 22/8/11: Cake Pay's privacy policy and terms of service have been updated[^22]; PR was closed.**
