bordecraft[^1] has successfully managed to run a Monero node on their *Steam Deck*[^2]:

> [..] the Steam Deck has a zen 2 ryzen CPU and a pretty good SSD so you can run anything on it[^3]

The setup process should be straightforward for Arch Linux[^4] users, as Steam Deck comes with the Arch-based *SteamOS 3.0*, which is being developed by Valve[^5].
