Spirobel[^1] has created a tutorial video[^2] in which he is setting up a local testnet[^3] for Monero development *in under 5 minutes*:

> [..] I made a repository on Github and I will show you now how you can interact with it and use it to set up your own personal Monero testnet (1:34)

For more information, consult the associated *Monerochan.news* article[^5] and *monero-playground*[^5] Github repository.
