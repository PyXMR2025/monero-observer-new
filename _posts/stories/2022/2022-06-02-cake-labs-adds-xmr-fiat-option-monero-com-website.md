Cake Labs[^1] has added a new option to buy and sell XMR with fiat on the *Monero.com*[^2] website:

> You can now buy and sell Monero with FIAT on Monero.com! SEPA, SWIFT, and Visa/Mastercard are supported[^3]

Fiat trades require KYC (unlike crypto to crypto trades) and are available in most countries, excluding USA.

There are plans to make this option available in the *Monero.com by Cake Wallet* via Blockbuy[^4], according[^5] to Cake Wallet's *VP of Operations* Justin Ehrenhofer[^6].

To learn more about Cake's Monero-only wallet, consult my previous report[^7].

**Update: residents in 40 US states can now buy XMR with Visa/Mastercard[^8].**
