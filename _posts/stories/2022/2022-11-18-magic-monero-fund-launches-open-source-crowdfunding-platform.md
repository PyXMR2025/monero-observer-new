*MAGIC Monero Fund*[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of a new open-source crowdfunding website[^3], a *campaign donation tracker that works with Monero, Bitcoin, and credit/debit*[^4]:

> This platform is essential for the committee to be able to raise money for crowdfunding campaigns. Previously, the committee relied on GoFundMe and manual cryptocurrency donations.

The platform accepts XMR and BTC donations via BTCPayServer[^5] and the project's source code is available on Github[^6].

To learn more about MAGIC, consult the previous Monero Observer report[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
