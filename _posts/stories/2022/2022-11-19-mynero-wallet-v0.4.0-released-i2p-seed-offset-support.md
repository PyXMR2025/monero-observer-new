pokkst[^1] has released version 0.4.0[^2] of MyNero Wallet[^3] with *I2P and seed offset support*:

> This update brings the ability to connect to I2P nodes, seed offset support, and a new "Street Mode" [..] Seed offset support works much like a Bitcoin wallet's BIP39 passphrase.[^4]

### Changes overview

```
- I2P node support!
- Wallets can now have seed offsets
- Added "Street Mode"
- Wallet syncing has been slightly optimized
- UI changes and touch-ups [..]
```

The complete changelog is available on the website[^5].

It is worth mentioning that this project's Github repository[^6] is no longer maintained[^7], as pokkst decided to move the source code to I2P[^8].

To support the project you can donate XMR to the address listed on the website[^3].

*Note: The seed offset is **not** shown anywhere in app, so be sure to keep it safe. If you opted to use this feature, wallet recovery is not possible without the password.*
