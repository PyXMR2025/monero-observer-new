DangerousFreedom1984[^1] has submitted the first progress report[^2] for their CCS[^3] proposal to build Python tools that check for inflation in Monero:

> I would like to give you an update about my project. [..] I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY BUG THAT COULD LEAD TO INFLATION UP TO NOW.

### Progress overview

- Created functions to check and generate MLSAG signatures in Python.
- Created functions to check and generate Borromean signatures in Python.
- Created some educational material to explain these concepts.
- Improved my point multiplication function. [..]

### Planned work (June)

- Start creating some codes and explanations about CLSAG and Bulletproofs
- Continue scanning the blockchain for part of the MLSAG era [..]

The full progress report is available on Gitlab[^2].
