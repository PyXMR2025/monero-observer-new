BitcartCC[^1] payment processor version 0.6.14.0[^2] (CLI v0.9.0[^3]) was released with support for Monero:

> My open-source payment processor has now implemented monero support for our developer SDK and merchants solutions. You host it on your own server and can connect it to any daemon RPC or your own node.[^4]

A live demo is available on *admin.bitcartcc.com*[^5] and the complete documentation can be found on *docs.bitcartcc.com*[^6].

To support the open-source project, donate XMR on *bitcartcc.com*[^1]. 

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
