Monero Trezor users will experience *four days of service disruption*[^1] after the v15 HF[^2], according to matejcik[^3]:

> Bad news everyone. We will not be able to do a firmware release this month. The originally announced date, August 17, is back in the game. I've seen that you pushed back HF activation to August 13, so that is only **four days of service disruption**.

The v15 Monero network upgrade was only recently rescheduled due to hardware wallet and multi-sig audit delays, as previously reported[^4].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/8/17: New Trezor firmware was released[^5].**
