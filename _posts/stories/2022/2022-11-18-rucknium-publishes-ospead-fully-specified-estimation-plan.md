Rucknium[^1] has published the *currently disclosable portion* of their *Fully Specified Estimation Plan for Optimal Static Parametric Estimation of Arbitrary Distributions (OSPEAD)*[^2] document:

> I've posted the currently disclosable portion of my submission to the OSPEAD scientific review panel [..] Feedback is welcome.[^3]

The 84-page full version of the document explains *a method to greatly improve Monero's decoy selection algorithm* and was submitted to the OSPEAD review panel (ArticMine, hyc, and isthmus):

> Probabilistic timing analysis is probably only relevant for Monero users with extreme threat models. But we want to build Monero to the highest standard possible. OSPEAD is designed to minimize the usefulness of timing analysis for enemies of privacy.[^4]

The *MAGIC Monero Fund*[^5] is currently hosting a fundraiser[^6] for *mj-xmr*[^7], looking to support OSPEAD with *C++ programming work*.

Consult Rucknium's funded CCS proposal[^8] to learn more about OSPEAD[^9].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: selsta has warned against donating to mj-xmr's MAGIC proposal[^10].**
