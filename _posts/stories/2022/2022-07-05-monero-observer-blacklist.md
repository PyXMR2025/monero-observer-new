A Monero Observer **Blacklist**[^1] section is now available on the website:

> Directory of up-to-date suspicious ecosystem projects that Monero users should avoid.

Please note that this is a *WiP*. Edits and suggestions can be sent to me, preferrably via XMPP.

Let me know if you find this useful.
