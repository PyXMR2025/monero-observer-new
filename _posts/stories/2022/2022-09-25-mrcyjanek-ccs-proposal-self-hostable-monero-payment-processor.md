mrcyjanek[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to develop a *selfhostable, optionally custodial, single-purpose [Monero] payment processor*:

> Once funded I expect to write the software in under a month, software will be of course open source and all development will hapen on a personal Gitea instance and will be mirrored to github.

```
Total funding: 10 XMR.

ETA: <1 month.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Develop fully working backend (UI+API) (8 XMR, up-front)
- M2: Write documentation and api usage examples (2 XMR)

This is mrcyjanek's first ever CCS proposal. Links to previous dev work were not included in the submission.
