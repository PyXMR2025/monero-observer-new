LefterisJP[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to integrate Monero into *Rotki*[^3], an open source privacy-focused portfolio manager:

> The proposal intends to offer support for tracking user monero balances, exploring monero transaction history and doing accounting for it in rotki.

```
Total funding: 532 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Research about monero, its RPC and best way forward (79.8 XMR)
- M2: Integrate with monero-wallet-rpc (212.8 XMR)
- M3: Integrate with monero-lws or openmonero (239.4 XMR)

Read issue #825[^4] in the *rotki* Github repository to learn more about this idea.
