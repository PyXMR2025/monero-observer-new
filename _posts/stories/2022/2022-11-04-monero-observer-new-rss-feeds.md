The Monero Observer **RSS**[^1] page has been updated and the following new feeds are now available:

- *feed-headlines.xml*[^2] (only includes the titles from feed.xml)
- *feed-stories-mini.xml*[^3] (only fetches the most recent <50 items in feed-stories.xml)
- *feed-dev.xml*[^4] (only includes the weekly *Monero Dev Activity Reports*)

The currently inactive feed-ta.xml will remain listed on the page for historical reasons.

Thanks for your feedback and suggestions! Send more @ [/about](/about).
