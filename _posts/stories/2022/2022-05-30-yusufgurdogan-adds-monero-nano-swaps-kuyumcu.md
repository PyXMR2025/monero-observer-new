yusufgurdogan[^1] has announced[^2] the addition of Monero/Nano[^3] swaps to Kuyumcu (nano.trade[^4]) *simple swap service*, after community vote[^5]:

> 3 months ago, I asked you guys about which coins would you like to swap with Nano. Monero got the most votes, so here is the simple swap service that I built! monero.nano.trade

Read the full blog announcement post[^2] to learn more about the service. 

Note that the site is currently under maintenance until June 3rd, as *something went wrong with the swap system*[^6].

*This is an ongoing story and it will be updated as soon as new information is available.*

**Update 22/09/09: the swaps are back online[^7].**
