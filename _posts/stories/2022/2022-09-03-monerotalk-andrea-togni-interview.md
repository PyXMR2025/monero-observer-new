In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews *Monero Policy Working Group (MPWG)[^4]* member Andrea Togni, on the necessity of privacy, property rights, liberty and Monero:

> [..] Monero is my favorite coin [..] because I think that probably you cannot have good money without some strong privacy by default (Andrea @ 05:40)

Several other topics are also discussed in this interview, including the Tornado Cash ban[^5], how the state controls education, the trade off between auditability and privacy, and the upcoming Washington Square Park Halloween privacy protest[^6].

Note that Andrea doesn't currently have any active social media accounts.
