Both John Foss's *The Monero Moon*[^1] and hinto-janaiyo's *monero-bash*[^2] CCS funding proposals were closed today:

- The Monero community reached consensus to temporarily close John's proposal, until he *returns to follow up*[^3]

- hinto-janaiyo decided to finish developing version 2.0.0 of the Linux CLI wrapper for Monero on his *own time instead*[^4]

Consult the previous two *Monero Community Workgroup Meeting* logs[^5]'[^6] to learn more about this development.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
