HashVault.pro[^1] is now the top XMR mining pool, with ~40% of the total Monero network hashrate, after today's unexpected ~325% hashrate surge, from under 400 MH/s to over 1.3 GH/s.

This is the first time since August, when MineXMR shut down[^2], that a pool other than Nanopool.org and SupportXMR.com ranks #1.

P2Pool's HR is down ~22% for the day.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/10/26: HashVault.pro's HR dropped back to *normal* levels (~500 MH/s).**

**Update 22/11/1: HashVault.pro's HR spiked again today (~1.1 GH/s: 800 MH/s solo, 300 MH/s pool).**
