P2Pool Mini[^1], the sidechain for low hashrate miners, has reached 1000 active miners, bringing the combined number of P2Pool[^2] miners to over 1500.

The recent 0.17.3.2[^3] Monero GUI release added experimental support for P2Pool mining, potentially contributing to the recent boost in the number of miners.

Miners are encouraged to stay away from big pools and join decentralized Monero mining pools P2Pool and P2Pool Mini in order to avoid centralization of the Monero network. 

For more information, consult previous Monero Observer reports:

To get help from other miners, anyone can join *#monero-pools*, *#p2pool-mini* and *#p2pool-log* channels on IRC/Libera.chat[^4].
