mj-xmr[^1] has announced[^2] the v0.2-beta[^3] pre-release for the *SolOptXMR*[^4] (Solar Optimal mining of XMR) project, which completes *half* of the associated CCS proposal[^5]'s 3rd milestone:

> [..] I'd like to present my part of the Milestone 3: The vendor independent measurements. [..] This pre-release is one step before being able to automate the act of switching the mining on and off. [..]

### Changes overview

- Random seed
- Charging above the minimum before mining
- Image tests for all supported images & scripts
- Json reader refactoring
- Docs - OCR & rectangle recognition 
- [..]

The full changelog[^3]'[^6] is available on Github.

The Monero community is encouraged to leave feedback in the announcement thread[^2], so mj-xmr can collect their part of the payment for the already completed work.

**Update: community voted against allowing CCS milestones to be split up in today's meeting[^7].**
