kayabNerve[^1] has shared a proof of concept tool, *Monero Secret Sharing*[^2], which provides a way to back up an XMR wallet among trusted parties:

> A tool to generate a Monero wallet distributed across the specified amount of shares with the specified amount required to recover the wallet as a whole.

Note that this is not a multisig tool and it only supports generating testnet addresses.

Consult the *README.md*[^3] file for more details and inspect the source code before using the software.
