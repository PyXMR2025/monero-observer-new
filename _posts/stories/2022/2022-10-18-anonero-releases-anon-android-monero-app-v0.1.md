ANONERO[^1] has released alpha version 0.1[^2] of *ANON*[^3], an open source Android-only XMR app focused on privacy and security, based on xmrwallet's Monero C++ library.

### v1.0 roadmap

- Monero only
- Default tor + proxy
- No 3rd-party services
- Required passphrase
- Polyseed mnemonic
- No subaddress reuse
- Encrypted backups
- Background sync
- Offline mode

Build instructions and .APK downloads are available on Gitea[^4].

Users are encouraged to inspect the GPLv3-licensed source code, test v0.1 basic functionality, submit PR's and open new issues.

To support ANONERO's work, you can donate XMR to the address listed on the project's onionsite[^5] and eepsite[^6].

*Note that this project is still a WiP and the code has not been audited.*

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
