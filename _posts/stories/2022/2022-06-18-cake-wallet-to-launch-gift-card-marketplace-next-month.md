Cake Wallet[^1] is looking to launch a gift card marketplace within the next month, according to Justin Ehrenhofer[^2]'s MoneroKon22[^3] virtual presentation video[^4]:

> [..] I wanna announce two things of many that we are working on with Cake Wallet [..] a gift card marketplace, which is available for XMR, BTC and LTC, and an Exchange Auto Router (1:55)

The marketplace will start with *select US merchants*, most of the gift cards will have a discount averaging around 2% and there are *no plans to charge a convenience fee*, according to Cake Labs[^5].

Note that users will need to provide an email address for gift card confirmation forwarding. 

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: marketplace launched[^6].**
