spirobel[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of *SuccessOnly*[^3], a new Monero remote worker site for Afghans:

> Monero Sticker spotted in Kabul! New Monero remote worker site for Afghanistan now online! [..] Let me know if you have any questions!

The first job[^4] was successfully completed[^5] earlier today:

```
[50 USD in xmr] Print out a Monero sticker and place it somewhere in Kabul 
```

It is worth noting that spirobel's previous CCS proposal[^6] to write a Monero Afghanistan expansion strategy paper was closed *for staleness with negative engagement ratio*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
