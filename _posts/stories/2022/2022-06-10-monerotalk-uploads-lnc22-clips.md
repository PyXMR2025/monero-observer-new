Monero Talk[^1] has uploaded some video[^2] and audio[^3] clips from the 2022 Libertarian National Convention (*LNC22*[^4]), which took place in Reno, Nevada at the Nugget Casino Resort[^5] on May 26-29:

> Doug and Sunita headed out West to the Libertarian National Convention in Reno, Nevada on a mission to find out if these liberty loving individuals were aware of and already using and spreading Monero, and if not, to find out why. 

Douglas Tuman[^6] discussed Monero with several Libertarian Party[^7] members, including Jeremy Kauffman[^8] and DanForTexas[^9]. 

The team also onboarded *a bunch of people on the spot* to Monero.com Wallet[^10] with a $10 XMR tip, *made progress toward getting the Libertarian National Committee to accept Monero donations* and served up fresh Gratuitas.org[^11] espresso at the event.
