DarkFi[^1] dev Rachel-Rose O'Leary[^2] has stated that *Monero is better than Zcash* in an interview with Justin Murphy on *Zero-Knowledge Crypto-Anarchy*[^3]:

> I would say that Monero is better than Zcash insofar as it has a genuinely grassroots community and it has a lot of support on the darknet markets and just in general I think it has more transactions per day than Zcash [..] (13:03)

Rachel-Rose was also a MoneroTopia guest and speaker a few months ago (Ep. 56[^4], XMR4ALL[^5]).
