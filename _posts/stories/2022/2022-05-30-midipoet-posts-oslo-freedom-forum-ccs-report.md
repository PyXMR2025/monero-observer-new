midipoet[^1] has posted a CCS[^2] update[^3] after attending the 2022 *Oslo Freedom Forum*[^4] annual human rights conference last week:

> I was able to discuss Monero as neutral tool (as opposed to a tool for criminals), Norwegian data centre (mining) tax incentives, and the state of CBDCs with Ola Elvestuen, a Norwegian member of parliament. 

Read the full report on Reddit[^3] and consult the previous Monero Observer report[^5] for more information about the CCS proposal[^2].
