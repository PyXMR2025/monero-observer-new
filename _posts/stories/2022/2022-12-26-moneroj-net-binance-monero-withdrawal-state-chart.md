CryptoMorpheus_[^1] has built a new Moneroj.net chart[^2] that shows the state of Binance withdrawals for Monero:

> Hi guys, happy to announce that Moneroj.net will start storing Binance withdrawal status for Monero and plot it in a chart. You'll be able to see the withdrawal status on the main page, plus this is a metric the website will save every hour.[^3]

To support CryptoMorpheus_'s work and keep the Moneroj.net project free for everyone, donate XMR to the address listed on the About[^4] page.
