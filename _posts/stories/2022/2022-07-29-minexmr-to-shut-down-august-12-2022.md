The #1[^1] Monero mining pool, MineXMR[^2], is apparently planning to close the pool on August 12, just before the v15 Monero network upgrade[^3], and recommending *transitioning to the decentralised p2pool[^4]*:

> We regret to inform our valued miners that the pool will be closing on August 12. Please reconfigure your miners to use a different pool before this date. Any miners that are not updated before August 12 will stop working. 

xnbya[^5], MineXMR's admin, has previously cooperated[^6] with the Monero community by increasing the pool fee from 1% to 1.1% in an attempt to discourage centralization.

It will be interesting to see where ~40%[^7](~940 MH/s of 2.3 GH/s) of the total Monero network hashrate will go: how many MineXMR miners start using the decentralized P2Pool[^3], switch to #2 Nanopool[^8] and other centralized pools, go solo, or just quit.

Consult previous reports[^9]'[^10]'[^11] for demos and guides, if you need help getting started with P2Pool.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: closure delayed[^12].**
