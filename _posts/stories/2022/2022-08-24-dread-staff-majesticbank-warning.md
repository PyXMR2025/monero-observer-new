Dread[^1] forum administrator *Paris*[^2] has issued an urgent *exit scam* warning[^3] after MajesticBank[^4]'s subdread[^5] and main admin account had been wiped *without any explanation*:

> Yesterday the admin started deleting their posts/comments and then deleting posts and comments within this subdread [..] There is little explanation for such actions if not to clean house and perform an exit scam. Without any explanation from the admin, **Dread staff urges nobody use Majestic Bank.**[^3]

The Monero community is currently discussing this incident on IRC/Matrix[^6]:

> [..] Sub has been deleted and dread accounts deleted and people reporting that they are not receiving their money[^7]

MajesticBank has previously paid the hosting fees for the official getmonero.org website ($6K for May/June/July 2022)[^8], funded Monero development[^9], gave away 40 Monerokon22 tickets[^10], and is a *top* Haveno sponsor[^11].

The majesticbank.sc official website is still online, but users are advised to (temporarily) avoid the exchange service.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available. Monero Observer reached out to MajesticBank for comment.*

**Update 22/8/25: pluja from kycnot.me reported that the MajesticBank exchange service is still working at least *for small trades up to 0.5XMR*[^12]; the *MajesticBank* Matrix account was active today in the *-community* room[^13].**

**Update 22/8/31: the website is down[^14].**
