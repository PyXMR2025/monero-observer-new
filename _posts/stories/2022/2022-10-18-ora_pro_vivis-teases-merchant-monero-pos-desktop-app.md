Ora_pro_vivis[^1] is teasing[^2] *Merchant*[^3], an upcoming Monero point-of-sale desktop app for *receiving & tracking Monero sales & payments in person*:

> [..] I have been developing a point of sale desktop app for accepting in person payments of Monero at your place of business. [..] an Electron JS native desktop app that uses the MoneroJS library

### Features overview

- XMR, USD support
- noncustodial
- store, track and export sales to PDF or CSV
- print receipts using USB thermal printer
- connect to local or remote nodes 

A stagenet video demo[^4] and some screenshots are currently available on the website.

An alpha version should *hopefully* be released for testing in *early 2023* and the source code will *most likely* be licensed MIT[^5].

Project supporters can donate[^6] XMR to help fund the development and cover the hosting and domain name registration costs. 

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: alpha *pushed back a little further into this year* [2023][^7].**
