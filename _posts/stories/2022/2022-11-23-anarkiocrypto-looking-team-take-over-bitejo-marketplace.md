AnarkioCrypto[^1] is currently looking for a team to *take over*[^2] Bitejo[^3], the crypto marketplace that accepts Monero, Bitcoin and cash:

> Looking for a team to take over the Bitejo crypto marketplace project. In the 1+ year since launch, I was unable to make it successful and I don't have the skills to do this. [..] If you are interested, please comment or PM.

The platform's *WiP* source code was recently uploaded to Codeberg[^4] and anyone is *free to recode it or start from scratch*.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
