kayabaNerve[^1] is teasing[^2] *Serai*[^3], an upcoming cross-chain decentralized exchange for Monero and other coins built in Rust[^4], which will offer a *liquidity pool trading experience*:

> After multiple months in development, I am happy to finally, and properly, announce Serai!

Unlike with other DEX platforms and atomic swap implementations, Serai users will not be required to run a node to provide liquidity or stay online until the exchange is finalized.

The DEX will initially support XMR, BTC, ETH, DAI and USDC. Apparently[^5] there are no plans to *ever* support fiat on the platform.

Trading fees will be paid to liquidity providers and block reward to validators, but the exact model is still being discussed.

Cake Labs[^6] announced plans[^7] to integrate Serai in Cake Wallet[^8] and Monero.com[^9], while QuerciaLabs[^10] offered[^11] to do a security audit for the project.

No ETA was provided for the public testnet, but we should have more news *within a month or two*, when it should be ready for initial testing.

Consult the associated Github repository[^12] for more details about Serai.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

---

**Update 22/7/9: the project is currently looking for developers, as suggested by kayabaNerve in a private conversation with MO: *we are hiring accordingly*. Contact via IRC[^13], Matrix[^14] or Discord[^15].**

**Update 22/7/25: kayabaNerve to present Serai DEX in Monero Meetup event on August 9th[^16].**

**Update 23/1/2: CypherStack begins Serai cryptography audit[^17].**
