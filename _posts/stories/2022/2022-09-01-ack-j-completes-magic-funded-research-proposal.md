ACK-J[^1] has posted the final update (July-August 2022)[^2] for their MAGIC[^3]-funded research proposal[^4]:

> This is the fifth and final update delivered for my MAGIC grant, detailing the work I have completed from July 1st to August 31st. [..] I want to thank the MAGIC committee for their support over the last six months, helping me complete my research!
