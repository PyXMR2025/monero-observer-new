SolOptXMR (*Solar Optimal mining of XMR*[^1]) versions 0.4-rc1[^2] and 0.4-rc2[^3] were released, mainly thanks to mj-xmr[^4]'s ~~and endorxmr[^5]'s~~ development efforts.

This completes the fourth and final *full automation* milestone of the associated CCS proposal[^6]:

> This version brings full automation (after an initial setup investment) and a lot of stability via fast corner case testing, that allowed me to fix prevailing bugs and enables further, risky experiments.

### Changes overview

- New console visuals
- Testing corner cases
- Automation documentation and scripts
- Computer schedule
- Temperature control script 
- [..]

The full changelog[^3]'[^7] is available on Github.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: mj-xmr clarified that he has completed this milestone without major help from endorxmr, 'except for one PR and one review'[^8]; endorxmr agreed 'for mj to be paid for M4 in full'[^9].**
