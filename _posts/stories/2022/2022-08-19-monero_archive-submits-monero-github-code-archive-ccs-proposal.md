monero_archive[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to maintain a Sia network[^3] *archive* and a Gitea[^4] onionsite mirror of the Monero Github code for 1 year:

> Monero code should be mirrored on censorship resistant platforms to avoid being vaporized by a government order. I plan to setup a gitea hidden mirror to mirror all monero code on github as a backup, and regularly pack monero source code and upload them on sia network.

```
Total funding: 1.5 XMR.

ETA: ~1 year.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Tor gitea mirror (1.3 XMR)
- M2: Sia network archive (0.2 XMR)

**Update 22/8/20: Tor Gitea instance is now live[^5].**

**Update 22/9/24: moved to funding stage[^6] (100% funded).**

**Update 22/11/24: Tor onion service is currently down (no explanation provided).**
