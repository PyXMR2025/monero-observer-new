hinto-janaiyo[^1] has released beta version 0.9.0[^2] of the cross-platform GUI for mining Monero on P2Pool using XMRig, *Gupax*[^3]:

> All the major code is done, all that's left is documentation and testing over the next few days. There are a few things I'd like to mess with and/or optimize as well. From a UX perspective, it is (I think at least) extremely easy to download Gupax, input your Monero address and immediately start mining on P2Pool with XMRig, so, mission accomplished.[^4]

### Changes overview

- Added keyboard shortcuts
- Added PTY (actual terminals) for P2Pool/XMRig
- Added sudo screen for XMRig (macOS/Linux)
- Added Status tab
- Added plowsof to community nodes
- Bunch of fixes, optimizations, etc. [..]

The full changelog, sources, SHA256SUM and .asc files can be found on Github[^2] and on the new *gupax.io* website[^5].

According to a previous dev update[^6], we can expect version 1.0.0 to be released *around Christmas time*. 

Consult hinto-janaiyo's CCS proposal[^7] to learn more about the project.
