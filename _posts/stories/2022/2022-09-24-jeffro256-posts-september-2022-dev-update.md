jeffro256[^1] has posted the first monthly progress report[^2] for their Monero dev work CCS proposal[^3]:

> It has been over a month since I was funded, so I want to drop an update report. [..] stopped counting hours after September 17th once I hit the 80 hour mark.

### Work overview

- Goal #8 (closed)[^4] was completed here: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/8340.
- Goal #9 (closed)[^5] did not end up working out: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/8354. [..]

Relevant pull requests and *an incomplete timesheet* is available in the progress report[^2].

For the second month, jeffro256 plans to work *almost exclusively* on the GUI wallet and prioritize *securing remote GUI connections with SSL*.
