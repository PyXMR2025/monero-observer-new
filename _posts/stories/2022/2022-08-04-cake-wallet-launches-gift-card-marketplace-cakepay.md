Cake Labs[^1] has launched *Cake Pay*[^2], a gift card marketplace which allows Cake Wallet[^3] and Monero.com[^4] app users to instantly purchase gift cards with XMR, BTC and LTC:

> We are extremely excited to announce Cake Pay! Cake Pay is the largest update to Cake Wallet and Monero.com, ever.[^5]

### Overview

- Only email needed
- Buy arbitrary amounts, eg: $354.23
- Save 1-3% on ALL supported merchants
- Most cards work both online and in-store
- Works at over 150,000 locations in the US
- Brand new cards through authorized sellers
- Instant acceptance

The marketplace was first announced in June 2022. Read the previous Monero Observer report[^6] for more details.

Note that not everyone in the Monero community is happy with Cake Pay and their current privacy policy[^9]:

> [..] I cannot support or endorse Cakepay (ArticMine)[^10]

> [..] users should at least be informed about their policies .. which they seem to try and drown under a sea of "sponsorships" (r4v3r23)[^11]

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/8/7: added notice, quotes, and links to Cake Pay privacy policy[^9] (thanks to r4v3r23[^12] for the news tip).**
