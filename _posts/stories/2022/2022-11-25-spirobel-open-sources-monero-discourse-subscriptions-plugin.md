spirobel[^1] has open sourced[^2] the code for his *Monero Discourse Subscriptions* plugin[^3], which gives *users access to private Discourse groups and categories for Monero payments*:

> [..] there are no content restrictions if you selfhost [..] So it could be Patreon, OnlyFans or a Math course.[^4]

Watch the short demo video[^5] and read the deployment instructions[^6] to learn more about this software.

The plugin can be tested on *forum.monerochan.news*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: spirobel announced *Monerochan Merchant RPC*[^8], which was created *as part of* the *Monero Discourse Subscriptions* plugin.**
