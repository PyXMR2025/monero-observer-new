In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews *Bitcoin Policy Institute*[^3] fellow, Margot Paez[^4], on exploring Bitcoin & Monero:

> [..] I like what Monero has to offer [..] I think it's complementary and it's good to have a currency that is very privacy-centric [..] it actually puts good pressure and good critique on Bitcoin too .. (1:17:30)

The discussion gravitated towards the guest's view on crypto from a physics perspective and her opinion on Monero.
