HashVault.pro[^1] is, once more[^2], the top XMR mining pool, with ~39% of the total Monero network hashrate, after today's unexpected hashrate surge, from around 500 MH/s to over 1.1 GH/s.

Some Monero community members believe the ~340 MH/s *solo miner* can be indicative of *botnet activity*[^3].

P2Pool's HR is down ~4.3% for the day.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/12/31: HashVault.pro’s HR started dropping back towards normal levels (currently ~860 MH/s).**

**Update 23/1/2: HR back to 'normal' (sub-600 MH/s) levels.**
