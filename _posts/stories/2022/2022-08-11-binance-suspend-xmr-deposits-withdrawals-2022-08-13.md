Binance[^1] has announced[^2] that their exchange will support the v15 Monero mainnet hard fork[^3] and *deposits and withdrawals for XMR will be suspended approximately from 2022-08-13 14:00 (UTC)*.

It is unclear when XMR deposits and withdrawals will be reopened and users will **not** be notified:

> We will reopen deposits and withdrawals for XMR once we deem the upgraded network to be stable, and we will not notify users in a further announcement. 

XMR trading *will not be affected* during the upgrade.

Recent user reports suggest ongoing issues[^4]'[^5]'[^6] with XMR withdrawals. If possible, withdraw your XMR from Binance and other CEXs.
