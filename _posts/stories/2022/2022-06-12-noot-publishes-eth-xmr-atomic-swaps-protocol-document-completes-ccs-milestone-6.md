noot[^1] has published a document[^2] which describes a protocol for trustless, peer-to-peer ETH-XMR atomic swaps[^3], thus completing the 6th milestone for her CCS proposal[^4]:

> Hey, I've completed milestone 6 [..] Although I've had some reviews, I would certainly appreciate any more.

A summary of the document is available on Gitlab[^5].

The final CCS milestone (#7) should be completed soon:

> This milestone includes an in-browser UI for interacting with the swap network. [..] The last task to be done here is Metamask integration.

Consult my previous report[^6] to learn more about the project and *stagenet.md*[^7] for instructions on how to join the network and try out the swap as a XMR-taker or XMR-maker.
