Gingeropolous[^1] has posted a new progress report[^2] for their *Research Computing Upgrade*[^3] CCS proposal:

> I don't think I'll be able to meet my December 2022 deadline for completing this CCS (the last 2 milestones for monthly support), but the primary mission of the CCS has been completed: the most powerful server in the bunch has been upgraded to essentially max out its data storage.

Read the full post[^2] on Github and consult the previous Monero Observer report[^4] to learn more about this proposal.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
