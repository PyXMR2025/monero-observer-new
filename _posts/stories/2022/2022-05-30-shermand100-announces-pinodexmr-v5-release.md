shermand100[^1] has announced[^2] the new PiNodeXMR[^3] v5 release, which comes with support for P2Pool:

> The closest thing to a Monero OS for single board computers. [..] Not just for Raspberry Pi. Run your own Full or pruned node on a low power 24/7 device and spend Monero privately on your own node that you can trust.

### Changes

- Pre-build disk image or simple one-command-install
- Private and Public Node modes
- Support for tor & I2P
- Block Explorer, P2Pool
- Monero-LWS (included but in test)
- Live Node status, tx pool and connections viewable on Web Interface within your home network [..]

Full list of changes is available on Github[^4].

To learn more about the project, consult the project's code repository[^5].

**Update 22/7/26: PiNodeXMR v5 disk images out now with Monero v0.18.0.0[^6].**
