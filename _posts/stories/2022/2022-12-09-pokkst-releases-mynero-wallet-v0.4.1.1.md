pokkst[^1] has released version 0.4.1.1[^2] of MyNero Wallet[^3]:

> [..] while this is a small update, it does introduce a new receive screen with a list of previously generated addresses, and a new default I2P node ran by me for people who do not wish to run their own node to test out I2P.[^4]

### Changes overview

```
- Adds a default I2P node, ran by me
- New, quick "Donate" button added to the send dialog
- Adds new "Occasional Donation" feature.
- Added option to hide Monerochan on home screen
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- New receive screen [..]
```

The complete changelog is available on the website[^5].

To support the project you can donate XMR to the address listed on the website[^3].

*Note that this project's Github repository[^6] is no longer maintained[^7], as pokkst decided to move the source code to I2P[^8].*
