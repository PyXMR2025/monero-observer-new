Haveno[^1] has requested the release of remaining funds from their frontend development CCS[^2] (453 XMR) to *resume development of the UI as soon as possible*[^3]:

> Hey everyone, we are doing our best to try to resume development of the UI as soon as possible. We are looking at solutions and something that would be extremely helpful is to be able to receive the 3 missing rewards (two we already received) all at once.

Haveno plans to convert the XMR funds to stablecoins to *remove the risk of a swing of price*[^4], and then pay the UI team.

Although CCS funds are normally released after development is done, the Monero community could vote to make exceptions in special circumstances.

Contributors are encouraged to post questions and feedback in !295[^5] on Gitlab.

Consult the previous Monero Observer report[^6] for more details about Haveno's CCS proposal.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
