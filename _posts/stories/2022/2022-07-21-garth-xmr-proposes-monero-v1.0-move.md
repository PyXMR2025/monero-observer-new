garth-xmr[^1] has proposed[^2] moving versioning for the Monero software to 1.0, arguing that *[zero versioning] is less applicable for a somewhat mature project like Monero*:

> I would like to invite feedback toward using the next major software release (eg: v0.19, and likely to be Seraphis) as an opportunity to move away from the v0 versioning that has served the project well from its humble beginnings, but is no longer as helpful these eight years later.

hyc[^3] agreed and added[^4] that the community could also take advantage of this opportunity to rename `.bitmonero` to `.monero`, since all wallets need to be recreated and that is *definitely a major enough change*.

fluffypony[^5] suggested[^6] creating a list of v1.0 deliverables before switching to *Semantic Versioning*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
