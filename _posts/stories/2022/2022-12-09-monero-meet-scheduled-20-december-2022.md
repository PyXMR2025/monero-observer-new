The next Monero Meet livestream[^1] is scheduled[^2] to take place on Tuesday, December 20th 2022 at 1900 UTC (1 PM CT):

> It's been a long time since the last Monero Meet in January, and even longer since I hosted them regularly (over 2 years ago). But, they're back! [..] They will occur every 4 weeks, rain or shine!
 
### Proposed agenda

```
Recent Monero news
How people can contribute
Current initiatives and progress
Future developments
Research lab "office hours"
Guiding philosophies
```

Participants can use *VDO Ninja*[^3] to join the *casual video call*. Get in touch with host Justin Ehrenhofer[^4] for more information.

The video recording will be uploaded to the Monero Meet channel[^1].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: recording available[^5].**
