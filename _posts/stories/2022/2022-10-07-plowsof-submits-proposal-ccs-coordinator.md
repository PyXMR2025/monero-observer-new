plowsof[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to work as *Community Relations / CCS Coordinator* at full capacity for 3 months:

> I voluntarily took on this role for a few weeks (several months ago) and detailed my progress here[^3]. Soon after, I 'retired'. Since then, i've been doing this role at half capacity.

```
Total funding: 69 XMR.

ETA: 3 months.
```

### Milestones

- M1: 2 meetings + performance reviewed (23 XMR)
