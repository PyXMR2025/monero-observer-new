*Monero Community Art Fund*[^1] admin TwistedTurtle[^2] has announced[^3] *Monerochan.io*[^4], a new platform where users can *post anything Monerochan related* and receive peer-to-peer tips:

> Post anything Monerochan related that you've illustrated, photographed, commissioned, or generated. If it wouldn't exist without you, it's fair game. I'll be using this as a repository for my best AI generations. My tip address is the art fund.

Perhaps the most interesting feature is the XMR wallet signing based authentication.

It is worth noting that lza_menace[^5] is the developer behind the *nerochan*[^6] open source software.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
