rehrar[^1] has released the first Stack Wallet[^2] alpha version (1.5.19[^3]) for desktop:

> Stack Wallet desktop alpha is here. There are a few known issues, but mostly just cosmetic in nature. Linux-only for now. Windows/Mac coming within the week. If anyone has a Linux machine or VM and cares to give it a try, that'd be appreciated.[^4]

### Changes overview

- Adjustment to adding nodes to put IP and Port on their own lines
- Fixes to difficult to click fields in Exchange
- Adjustment to estimated fees for Monero

Release notes and the .AppImage download can be found on Github[^3].
