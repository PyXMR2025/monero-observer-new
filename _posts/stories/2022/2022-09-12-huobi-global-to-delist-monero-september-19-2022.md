Huobi Global[^1] has announced[^2] plans to delist Monero and other *privacy tokens* on September 19 2022 at 08:00 (UTC):

> In compliance with the latest financial regulations and in accordance with Article 17(16) of the Huobi Global Token Management Rules, Huobi Global has terminated the trading service of the following privacy tokens: **DASH, DCR, FIRO, XMR, XVG, ZEC, and ZEN** on Sept 6, 2022. **The delisting of these tokens is scheduled to start at 08:00 (UTC), Sept 19, 2022.**

The deposit service for the specified cryptocurrencies will cease on Sept 12 at 08:00 (UTC), but the withdrawal service will continue to function.

Users should cancel open orders *in a timely manner* and withdraw their assets from the platform before the deadline.

Monero Core's Francisco Cabanas[^3] suspects that the fundamental cause of this delisting is the *lobbying efforts of the blockchain surveillance (BS) companies*[^4].

According to Cake's Justin Ehrenhofer[^5], *South Korea regulators demanded that Huobi delist these assets worldwide.*[^6]

The Monero community is currently discussing this development in *r/Monero*[^7].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
