```
Milestone 2:
- Continued with v0.18 preparations (set fork height, prepare branch)
- Worked together with Ledger to prepare for the hardfork (code was written by j-berman)
- Fixed 4 smaller GUI bugs
- Research into increased min glibc version, since I got stuck I reached out to TheCharlatan who solved the issue
- Docker and dependency updates for GUI
```
