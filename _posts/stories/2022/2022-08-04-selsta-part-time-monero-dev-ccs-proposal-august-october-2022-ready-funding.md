selsta[^1]'s new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of October 2022 is ready for funding:

```
47 contributors raised  110 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^3] page.
