Justin Ehrenhofer[^1] has asked[^2] the Monero community to make a *rapid, sensible decision* on what to do with the Defcon[^3] supplies for Monero / *Cryptocurrency Village*[^4] before the Las Vegas storage contract ends on July 31st:

> [..] we need to make a rapid, sensible decision on what to do with supplies. There is no Monero Village or Cryptocurrency Village this year, and there likely will not be a village in future years.

Justin shared some possible options for the community to consider:

- Option 1: We let Monero Talk take what they want for Monerotopia
- Option 2: We let a Monero community member pick up the supplies and hold them for storage
- Option 3: We let the Zcash Foundation take what they want for Zcon3, live in Vegas August 7-9
- Option 4: We let another Defcon village have the stuff they want
- Option 5: We keep paying the storage contract for $150/mo ($1,800/yr)

Supplies include 2 wireless mic receivers, an Xenyx 1202 FX behringer, an Epson projector, 2 32" TCL TVs, batteries, cables and badges. The complete list of supplies is available on Github[^2].

If you leave near Vegas and would like to help (Option 2), get in touch with Justin via email[^5], Signal[^6] or Matrix[^7].
