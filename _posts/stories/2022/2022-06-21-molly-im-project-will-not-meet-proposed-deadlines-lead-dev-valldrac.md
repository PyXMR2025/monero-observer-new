The *Molly.im*[^1] project will not be able to meet any of the *proposed deadlines*, according[^2] to the lead developer of the Android Signal fork, Oscar *valldrac* Mira[^3]:

> [..] one major issue at this time is the current drop in value of Monero [..] It is preventing us from outsourcing some engineering tasks as we had initially planned. Unfortunately, we are not going to meet any of our proposed deadlines as a result of these road blocks.

The team is still working on Monero integration, while exploring *alternate funding methods*, according to today's update.

Apparently no CCS payouts have been claimed to date.

To learn more about the project, read the January 2022 status update[^4], the associated CCS proposal[^5] and consult the initial Monero Observer report[^6].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
