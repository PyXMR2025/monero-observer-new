Nautilus Nano[^1] wallet version 0.6.4 will be released with *bare bones* XMR support, according to an announcement[^2] from community dev *fossephate*[^3]:

> [..] I admit it's really minimal just supporting sending, receiving, and setting the restore height, but its non-custodial (view keys aren't uploaded) and a good starting point

The new version will be released tomorrow for iOS and in *less than a week* for Android.

Note that the software uses the *monero-javascript*[^4] Node.js library.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update: upcoming update will remove support for XMR[^5].**
