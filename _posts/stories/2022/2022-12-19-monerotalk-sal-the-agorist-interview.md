In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3] interviews agorism advocate and crypto-anarchist, *Sal the Agorist*[^4]:

> Monero is the only one that I still am confident in, but [..] our enemy is the Fed and their one product is exchange medium, so we have to have a more efficient medium of exchange and I think that it's sort of an undeniable fact that base layer privacy [..] has been an obstacle to retail adoption, or to mass adoption .. (Sal @ 13:10)

Several topics are discussed in this interview, including agorism, XMR institutional adoption, CBDCs, Bitcoin Cash, base layer privacy, and Monero weaknesses.
