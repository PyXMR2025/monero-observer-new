CryptoMorpheus_[^1] has published an XMR adoption metrics report[^2] on Moneroj.net[^3] for the month of July 2022:

> On this article I make a quick resume of what has been this July for Monero's adoption on clearnet markets and on the darknet forum, Dread.[^4]

The *dread_subscribers*[^5] graph clearly shows that Monero is still #1 on Dread[^6]:

> Inside the most important forum available, Dread, Monero reigns supreme, with 7929 subscribers to its 'subreddit', against 87 members inside Bitcoin's.
