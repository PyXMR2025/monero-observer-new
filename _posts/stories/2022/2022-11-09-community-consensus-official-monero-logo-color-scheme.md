The Monero community is looking to reach consensus on the *official* Monero color scheme, after *Leza89*[^1] pointed out that *there are a lot of different "official" colors for the Monero logo*[^2]:

> So in total we have 4 different shades or orange [#F26822, #F2651C, #F16822, #FF6600] and 2 different types of grey [#4D4D4D, #4C4C4C].

Note that anyone will still be able to (under the *CC BY-SA 4.0*[^3] license) freely remix, transform, and create their own Monero logo designs and color schemes, regardless of outcome.

Post your comments and suggestions in MRL meta issue #752[^4].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*
