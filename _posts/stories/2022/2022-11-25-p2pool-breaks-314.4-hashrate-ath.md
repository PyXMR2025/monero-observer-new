P2Pool[^1]’s hashrate has reached a new all-time high of ~337 MH/s today and shows no signs of stopping, according to *p2pool.observer*[^2] and Moneroj.net's *p2pool_hashrate graph*[^3].

It is interesting to note that the previous record of 314.4 MH/s was registered almost exactly one year ago, on the 16th of November 2021.

P2Pool is currently the 3rd Monero mining pool with approximately 12.4% of the total network HR and 500+ miners.

P2Pool Mini[^4] has more miners (800+), but only a fraction of the hashrate (~10 MH/s).

**Update 22/11/26: *140 MH/s moved from supportxmr a couple days ago*, according to P2Pool dev sech1[^5]; HR still increasing, currently around 370 MH/s (+8.8%).**

**Update 22/11/27: HR dropped back to 'normal' levels under 240 MH/s (-33.3%).**
